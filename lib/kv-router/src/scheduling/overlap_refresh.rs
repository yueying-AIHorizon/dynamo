//! Re-query overlap scores at dequeue time.
//!
//! When a request has been parked in the scheduler queue, the KV cache state on each worker
//! may have changed significantly while it waited. The `tier_overlap_blocks` and
//! `effective_overlap_blocks` computed at enqueue time can be stale enough to pick the
//! wrong worker on dispatch.
//!
//! [`SchedulerQueue`](super::queue::SchedulerQueue) holds an optional refresher. When set,
//! the queue calls [`OverlapScoresRefresh::refresh`] for any request that waited longer than
//! the configured threshold, replacing the per-tier and effective-overlap fields on the
//! request with a fresh read from the indexer.
//!
//! The scope of refresh is intentionally narrow: it updates dispatch-time worker
//! selection/load inputs after an entry reaches the front of the queue, but it does not
//! re-key or reinsert that entry in the priority queue. Queue ordering therefore remains
//! based on the enqueue-time key, even when refreshed overlap data changes the eventual
//! worker chosen for dispatch.
//!
//! Refresh failures are non-fatal: an implementation can return `None` and the queue will
//! dispatch with the (stale) original scores rather than dropping the request.
