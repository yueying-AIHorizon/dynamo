# Concurrent Radix Tree Compressed

`ConcurrentRadixTreeCompressed` is a compressed trie for KV-cache routing. It
keeps the same logical shape as a radix tree, but each non-root node owns a
compressed edge: a vector of `(LocalBlockHash, ExternalSequenceBlockHash)` pairs.
This reduces node count and lets decode append to an existing leaf when the
parent hash is still the covered tail.

The tree supports splitting but not merging. Cleanup may remove stale leaves,
but a split edge is not recompressed later.

## Motivation

The original KV-router indexers optimize different tradeoffs:

- `RadixTree` is simple and exact, but it stores one block per trie node. Long
  shared prompts and decode tails create many nodes, and every append has to
  walk or allocate at block granularity.
- `RadixTreeIndex` improves concurrent event ingestion by sharding workers, but
  each shard is still an ordinary radix tree. Shared prefixes that cross shard
  boundaries are duplicated instead of represented by shared structure.
- `BranchShardedIndexer` routes divergent branches to different shards, but the
  underlying per-shard structure still needs to handle high fanout, decode
  extension, and stale parent lookups cheaply.

`ConcurrentRadixTreeCompressed` is the per-shard structure built for that shape.
Its main differences are:

- **Radix compression**: each non-root node stores a compressed edge instead of a
  single block. A prefill chain can be represented by one node, and decode can
  append directly to a leaf while the node is still childless.
- **Per-worker cutoffs**: worker coverage is tracked as a cutoff inside the
  compressed edge. Removal can shorten one worker's coverage without splitting
  the physical tree for every eviction.
- **Sticky internal nodes**: once a node has had children, it remains logically
  internal even if cleanup removes those children. This avoids reopening old
  fanout points for decode extension after races or cleanup.
- **Lazy lookup repair**: worker-local reverse lookups are repaired only when a
  stale entry is observed. Cross-thread splits do not need to synchronously patch
  every other thread's lookup table.
- **Semi-lock-free structural reads**: child storage uses immutable compact
  snapshots for up to four children and `DashMap` for higher fanout, while the
  edge state is protected separately. Hot read paths do not take the shape gate,
  and shape-sensitive writes use version validation to retry when a plan becomes
  stale.
- **Versioned shape gates**: the node's `shape_gate` and `shape_version` combine
  a small critical section with explicit stale-plan detection. Shared operations,
  such as adding a child under a stable internal node, can proceed with a shared
  gate; structural mutations, such as splits and leaf extensions, take the
  exclusive path.

The intended result is not a fully lock-free tree. It is a compressed tree where
common prefill fanout and decode extension avoid unnecessary exclusive
serialization, while rare structural races are resolved by retrying or lazily
repairing lookup state.

## Node State

Each node contains:

- `edge`: the compressed sequence of local and external block hashes.
- `edge_index`: reverse lookup from `ExternalSequenceBlockHash` to position in
  the edge. Removal uses this to find an evicted block in O(1) once it has the
  node.
- `full_edge_workers`: workers that cover the full compressed edge.
- `worker_cutoffs`: workers that cover only a prefix of the edge. A cutoff `k`
  means the worker has cached `edge[0..k]`, with `0 < k < edge.len()`.
- `children`: child nodes keyed by the first `LocalBlockHash` of the child
  edge.
- `shape_gate` and `shape_version`: a per-node shape guard used to validate
  plans across lock gaps.
- `internal`: a sticky marker that becomes true once the node has had children.
  It remains true even if cleanup later removes every physical child, so the
  node is not reopened for leaf extension.

Worker lookup tables are not stored on nodes. Each event worker owns its own
`WorkerLookup`, mapping external block hashes to the node that should contain
that hash.

## Store Paths

The indexer is optimized around two common KV-cache store patterns.

### Prefill Fanout

Many workers may share a prefix and then store different prompt suffixes under
the same parent:

```text
shared prefix parent
many different workers
many different first child hashes
insert new compressed child nodes
```

The desired behavior is to let independent child inserts proceed concurrently
when the parent edge is stable. Child insertion uses the shared shape gate and a
shape-version check, so it can proceed without exclusive edge-shape ownership.

### Decode Extension

During decode, a worker often appends small batches to the tail of its own
compressed edge:

```text
one worker
one leaf compressed node
parent hash is current tail
node has never been internal
append more blocks to the edge
```

This path attempts a direct leaf extension. It is allowed only when the node is
not `internal`, the parent hash is still the edge tail, and the worker covers
that tail. If the node has ever had children, decode falls back to child
insertion or splitting instead of extending the compressed edge.

### Suffix Reuse And Splitting

When a store names a parent hash inside an existing compressed edge, the node can
reuse a matching existing suffix. If the new store diverges from that suffix, the
node is split at the parent position. The suffix becomes a child node and keeps
the original children, so existing descendants remain reachable after the split.

The suffix retains the original child-storage representation. The prefix starts
with compact child storage for its new suffix child, even if it previously had a
sharded map. This avoids allocating a sharded map for a prefix with only a few
children. The prefix remains logically internal and cannot resume leaf extension.

## Removal

Removal updates worker coverage but does not structurally split edges.

When a remove event arrives for worker `w` at edge position `i`:

- `current_cutoff` is `edge.len()` if `w` is in `full_edge_workers`; otherwise
  it is `worker_cutoffs[w]`.
- If `i >= current_cutoff`, the remove is a no-op because the block is already
  beyond that worker's coverage.
- If `i < current_cutoff`, the new cutoff is `i`.
- If the new cutoff is `0`, the worker is removed from the node.
- Otherwise the worker moves to `worker_cutoffs[w] = new_cutoff`.
- Worker lookup entries for the newly uncovered suffix are scrubbed eagerly.

After the coverage update, removal may clear children only when no full-edge
workers remain. Because `internal` is sticky, clearing those children does not
make the node eligible for future leaf extension.

## Lookup Repair

Cross-thread splits can make a worker lookup entry stale: the lookup still points
at the old prefix node even though the requested external hash moved to the new
suffix child. `resolve_lookup` handles this lazily:

```text
worker lookup says hash -> old node
old node no longer contains hash
scan descendants for a node containing hash
rewrite the useful covered range in the resolved node
```

Store repair rewrites from the requested parent hash toward the worker's covered
tail. Remove repair rewrites from the head toward the removed hash, excluding the
suffix that removal is about to scrub. This matters for tail-to-head removes:
once one hash in a moved compressed edge repairs the useful head range, later
hashes in that same edge should hit the resolved node directly instead of paying
another subtree scan.

If the scan fails in a store path, the store is rejected with
`ParentBlockNotFound` and logged as a warning. If it fails in a remove path, the
remove treats the block as already gone or stale and skips it.

## Concurrency Model

`ThreadPoolIndexer` sticky-routes events by worker id, so a single worker's KV
events are serialized on one event thread. Different workers can still mutate
shared CRTC nodes concurrently.

Node internals use separate protection for edge state and child maps:

- `NodeState` is protected by a `parking_lot::RwLock`.
- `children` publishes compact snapshots through `ArcSwap`, promoting to a
  `DashMap` when fanout exceeds four children.
- `shape_gate` and `shape_version` coordinate plans that depend on the relation
  between the edge and child map.

Light shape updates, such as attaching a missing child under a stable parent, use
a shared shape gate plus version validation. Heavy edge-shape updates, such as
splitting an edge, extending a leaf, or moving children to a suffix node, use the
exclusive shape gate.

`find_matches` is best-effort during concurrent shape changes. It reads node
state and child pointers without taking `shape_gate` on the hot step, so it may
observe adjacent tree shapes during a split and undercount. It must not panic or
return a match past a valid reachable prefix.

## Wire Compatibility

- `find_matches` leaves the legacy `OverlapScores.frequencies` field empty.
