//! Shared schemas and primitives for Dynamo data generation.
//!
//! The crate hosts the Mooncake replay JSONL schema and helpers, plus the
//! Dynamo request-trace loader and transient lowering used to build mocker
//! replay models in memory. Direct Dynamo request-trace replay does not write
//! an intermediate Mooncake file; the opt-in `dynamo-bench` exporter writes
//! one when needed. Shared row types keep trace producers and consumers in
//! lockstep.
