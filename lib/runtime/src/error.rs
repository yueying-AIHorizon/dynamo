//! Dynamo's shared semantic error contract.
//!
//! A [`DynamoError`] describes **what failed**. It deliberately does not prescribe an HTTP status, retry action, stream action, or worker-health decision. Those decisions belong to the consumer that owns the relevant local state, such as response commitment, retry budget, replayability, deadline, and worker observations.
//!
//! The component closest to the cause classifies a failure once. Callers should propagate an existing [`DynamoError`] directly; internal transports preserve its semantic identity, and protocol boundaries render it for their clients. Generic conversion from an error chain recovers a typed non-internal semantic source, but it intentionally treats an unclassified or internal source as `Internal/runtime.unclassified`. See [DEP #14354](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/14354) for the architecture and rollout rationale.
//!
//! # Error identity
//!
//! Every error has two identity fields:
//!
//! - [`ErrorClass`] is the coarse, closed category used for exhaustive consumer policy. New producers should select a canonical class such as [`ErrorClass::InvalidRequest`] or [`ErrorClass::Unavailable`]. The older transport-specific variants are retained for compatibility and normalize through [`DynamoError::class`].
//! - [`ErrorReason`] is a stable, bounded catalog key that identifies the specific cause. A reason belongs to exactly one normalized class. It is safe for low-cardinality policy and metric dimensions; arbitrary exception text and user input are not.
//!
//! The builder and deserializer validate the class/reason pair. An unknown, malformed, or mismatched identity fails closed to `Internal/runtime.invalid_error`, and its public details are discarded. Consumers should therefore use [`DynamoError::class`], [`DynamoError::reason`], and [`DynamoError::public_details`] instead of reading the public fields directly. [`DynamoError::error_type`] exists for legacy policy only.
//!
//! ## Choosing a canonical class
//!
//! | Class | Use when |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`ErrorClass::InvalidRequest`] | The caller supplied malformed input or failed request-level validation. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::Unauthenticated`] | Authentication credentials are missing or invalid. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::PermissionDenied`] | The authenticated caller is not allowed to perform the operation. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::NotFound`] | A caller-visible resource does not exist. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::Conflict`] | The request conflicts with current resource state. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::PayloadTooLarge`] | The request exceeds an advertised size limit. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::UnsupportedMedia`] | The request uses an unsupported media type. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::RateLimited`] | A caller-specific admission or rate limit was exceeded. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::CapacityExhausted`] | Dynamo, a selected worker, or the eligible worker pool lacks capacity; the reason distinguishes worker overload from pool exhaustion. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::Cancelled`] | The request was cancelled, usually because the client disconnected. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::Unavailable`] | A service, worker, pool, or Dynamo-owned dependency is unavailable. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::BackendProtocol`] | A backend response violates the expected protocol. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::DeadlineExceeded`] | A request or attempt deadline expired. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::NotImplemented`] | A valid requested capability is unsupported. |
//! | [`ErrorClass::Internal`] | A defect, invalid classification, or otherwise unclassified failure occurred. |
//!
//! Similar symptoms do not necessarily have the same class. For example, malformed client input is [`ErrorClass::InvalidRequest`], invalid operator configuration is [`ErrorClass::Internal`], caller-specific throttling is [`ErrorClass::RateLimited`], and pool-wide capacity pressure is [`ErrorClass::CapacityExhausted`].
//!
//! # Data visibility
//!
//! [`Diagnostic`] contains bounded operator-facing context. It may be used in logs and traces, but it must never be copied into a client response or metric label. Do not place secrets, credentials, prompts, generated text, or raw upstream response bodies in a diagnostic.
//!
//! [`PublicDetails`] is the only occurrence-specific channel available for client rendering, but the type does not sanitize its values. Producers must populate it only at a boundary that knows the value is safe. A [`PublicDetails::Message`] must contain fixed, cataloged, or explicitly allowlisted text; it must not contain user input, prompts, generated content, secrets, URLs, diagnostics, or raw upstream responses. Never derive public details from a diagnostic or arbitrary backend exception text.
//!
//! # Producer guidance
//!
//! 1. Classify at the boundary that understands the cause instead of relying on message parsing farther downstream.
//! 2. Select the canonical class for the failure's meaning, independent of the current transport.
//! 3. Use a registered reason that belongs to that class. Add new reasons to the catalog with class-consistency tests rather than emitting dynamic strings.
//! 4. Add a diagnostic only when it improves operator debugging, and add public details only when they are explicitly client-safe.
//! 5. Propagate an existing [`DynamoError`] directly whenever possible. If a generic wrapper is unavoidable, retain the typed error as its source and remember that generic conversion recovers only non-internal semantic classifications.
//!
//! [`DynamoError::msg`], conversion from an unclassified [`std::error::Error`], and conversion from a generic wrapper whose typed source is internal intentionally produce `Internal/runtime.unclassified`; use them as a fallback, not for failures whose meaning is known.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use dynamo_runtime::error::{DynamoError, ErrorClass, ErrorReason};
//!
//! let error = DynamoError::builder()
//!     .class(ErrorClass::InvalidRequest)
//!     .reason(ErrorReason::new("request.invalid").expect("registered reason"))
//!     .diagnostic("messages[2].role failed validation")
//!     .public_message("The message role is invalid")
//!     .build();
//!
//! assert_eq!(error.class(), ErrorClass::InvalidRequest);
//! assert_eq!(error.reason().as_str(), "request.invalid");
//! assert_eq!(error.public_message(), Some("The message role is invalid"));
//! ```
//!
//! Structured details are preferable when the protocol renderer needs machine-readable values:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use dynamo_runtime::error::{DynamoError, ErrorClass, ErrorReason, PublicDetails};
//!
//! let error = DynamoError::builder()
//!     .class(ErrorClass::PayloadTooLarge)
//!     .reason(ErrorReason::new("request.payload_too_large").expect("registered reason"))
//!     .public_details(PublicDetails::SizeLimit {
//!         limit: 1_048_576,
//!         actual: Some(1_250_000),
//!     })
//!     .build();
//! ```
//!
//! # Consumer guidance
//!
//! Consumers apply their own policy to the validated semantic identity:
//!
//! - Protocol renderers map [`DynamoError::class`] to a status or legal terminal stream event and expose only approved [`PublicDetails`].
//! - Retry and migration code owns its reason policy and combines it with locally owned budget, deadline, routing, replay, and continuation state.
//! - Worker-health code combines the reason with local worker and pool observations rather than inferring health from an HTTP status.
//! - Metrics use the normalized class and registered reason. Diagnostics, request identifiers, exception types, URLs, and user-controlled values must not become labels.
//!
//! A recovered internal attempt is not a final client failure. Terminal failure accounting belongs at the frontend rendering boundary so one propagated error is not counted by every subsystem it crosses.
