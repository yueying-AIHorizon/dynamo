"""NOTICES-Rust.txt generator.

Reads CycloneDX 1.5/1.6 SBOMs embedded in installed wheels under the runtime
venv. The dynamo runtime + kvbm wheels ship these via cargo-cyclonedx (run
through maturin); NIXL ships its own once we wire cargo-cyclonedx into the
NIXL block in wheel_builder.

Rust binaries that ship in an image without going through a wheel are invisible
to that wheel scan, so their SBOMs are passed in explicitly via `extra_sboms`
(the `--rust-sbom` flag). The frontend image's `/epp` is the case this exists
for: it is built from the ext-proc crate in a separate image and copied in, so
nothing under site-packages describes it.

First-party crates (`dynamo-*`, `kvbm-*`, `nixl-*`, `nvidia-*`) are KEPT in
the output — auditors and customers should see every crate that's actually
in the binary, including ours.
