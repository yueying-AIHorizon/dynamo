# Upgrade DALI past its own media-codec cleanup. Upstream restricted DALI's
# vendored ffmpeg build to drop the software h264/hevc/aac decoders
# (NVIDIA/DALI_deps#162, NVIDIA/DALI#6352), first released in 2.1.1; the base
# image here carries 2.1.0, which predates it.
#
# Upgrade rather than remove. The vendored libav*/libsw* set cannot be trimmed
# on its own -- every one of them is DT_NEEDED by libdali.so and its siblings, so
# deleting the codec libraries breaks `import nvidia.dali` outright -- and while
# nothing in this image imports DALI today, it belongs to TensorRT-LLM rather
# than to us. A version bump removes the codec surface without taking a package
# out of someone else's image.
#
# Measured on the shipped image: 2.1.0 registers 446 decoders including h264,
# hevc, aac, aac_fixed and aac_latm; 2.1.1 and 2.2.0 each register 440 with all
# five absent and vp8/vp9/mjpeg/av1 retained.
#
# Pinned exactly, not a floor. `>=2.1.1` resolves to whatever is newest -- 2.2.0
# at the time of writing -- which is a minor-version jump into a component this
# repo does not own, taken silently at build time. 2.1.1 is the smallest change
# that removes the decoders, so it is the one to take.
#
# A pin can go stale in the one direction that matters: if TensorRT-LLM later
# ships a base image with a newer DALI, installing 2.1.1 over it is a downgrade.
# The check below turns that into a build failure with instructions rather than a
# silent regression, which also makes this block self-retiring -- when upstream
# catches up, the build tells whoever is looking to delete it.
#
# THIS BLOCK IS TRANSITIONAL. It exists because the base image predates upstream's
# own cleanup. The guards after it and the bundled-libavcodec assertion in
# tests/dependencies/test_no_software_video_codecs.py are NOT transitional: they
# are the permanent statement of what this image may contain, and they must
# outlive the workaround.
#
# System interpreter for the same reason as the opencv removal above: with
# VIRTUAL_ENV set, plain pip targets the venv and leaves the system-site copy in
# place. The guard enumerates what the library actually registers rather than
# trusting the version string, so a wheel that reintroduces a decoder fails the
# build. Mirrored by the pre_runtime whiteout below, which matters more here than
# for a deletion: DALI's libraries are hash-named, so an upgrade RENAMES them and
# the squash COPY would otherwise leave the old codec-carrying copy in place
# beside the new one.

# Upgrade PyNvVideoCodec past the release that stopped shipping a separate
# libavcodec. rc24 is the first TensorRT-LLM base image to ship this package at
# all, and it ships 2.1.0, which bundles libavcodec, libavdevice, libavfilter,
# libswresample and libswscale alongside the libavformat and libavutil it
# actually uses. 2.2.0 ships only the latter two -- but libavcodec is not gone,
# it is statically linked into libavformat.so.62. That distinction drives the
# content check below: after the upgrade no file is named libavcodec*, so a
# filename test cannot see a future release that re-enables decoders inside
# libavformat.
#
# This is a surface reduction, not a codec removal, and the difference from the
# DALI block above matters because the two look identical. 2.1.0's libavcodec
# registers exactly one decoder -- vp9 -- and no encoders: none of h264, hevc,
# aac, aac_fixed or aac_latm. That is by construction, not by luck: the vendor's
# own configure line ships in the image at /usr/local/external/ffmpeg/readme.txt
# and reads --disable-encoders --disable-decoders --enable-decoder=vp9. Measured
# with enumerate_bundled_decoders.py on both arches, and 2.2.0 drops even vp9.
#
# So no prohibited *decoder implementation* ships in either version -- but that
# is a narrower statement than "nothing prohibited ships". --disable-decoders
# disables decoders, not FFmpeg code in general: the h264/hevc/aac parsers,
# demuxers, muxers and bitstream filters (h264_metadata, hevc_metadata,
# h264_mp4toannexb, h264_redundant_pps -- these do full parameter-set parse and
# rewrite) remain enabled in both. Do not read the vp9-only finding as "no
# H.264 code present".
#
# What actually fails the build is container/compliance/policy/codec_policy.yaml,
# whose deny globs match on a libavcodec being present at all, and whose two
# PyNvVideoCodec waivers are deliberately scoped to libavutil and libavformat so
# that a bundled libavcodec has to be looked at rather than absorbed silently.
#
# The version of those libraries is the main reason to move, and it is easy to
# miss because the package ships no ffmpeg executable -- only shared libraries.
# 2.1.0's libavcodec.so.61.3.100 and libavformat.so.61.1.100 embed "FFmpeg
# version 7.0.2", and they are on the runtime path rather than inert: readelf -d
# on PyNvVideoCodec_130.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so lists libavformat.so.61,
# libavcodec.so.61, libswresample.so.5 and libavutil.so.59 as NEEDED. 2.2.0's
# libavformat.so.62.12.102 embeds "FFmpeg version 8.1.2", which is the floor
# deny_components sets for ffmpeg in codec_policy.yaml. 2.1.0 sits below it.
#
# Note that the gate did not tell us this. deny_components is evaluated against
# SBOM components (scan_codecs.scan_sbom), and the SBOM does not enumerate
# wheel-bundled .so files as an "ffmpeg" component -- the rc24 failure produced
# zero sbom: findings, and all 20 violations were filename globs. So the floor
# is unenforced for every wheel-vendored FFmpeg in every image, not just this
# one. Worth fixing in the scanner; do not assume this check has your back.
#
# Two further defects in 2.1.0 that 2.2.0 fixes: GPL-only libpostproc sources
# while NOTICES.txt declares LGPLv3 only, and on aarch64 binaries built from
# FFmpeg 7.1 shipped against a 7.0.2 source tarball -- an LGPL
# source-correspondence mismatch. Package size drops 52M -> 24M (2.1.0's
# bundled libs are real copies, not symlinks).
#
# Do NOT justify this upgrade as removing royalty exposure: the only decoder it
# removes is vp9, the royalty-free one, and royalties for the GPU-accelerated
# families are covered by the hardware licensing model.
#
# Upgrade rather than waive. A waiver has to be written as a glob, and a glob
# cannot say "this version's libavcodec is empty" -- it would carry forward to a
# future version whose libavcodec is not, disarming the check that just fired.
# Removing the file keeps the narrow waivers, and the tripwire, intact.
#
# A floor rather than an exact pin, unlike DALI above: requirements.trtllm.txt
# already installs PyNvVideoCodec>=2.2.0 into /opt/dynamo/venv, and pinning the
# system copy exactly would let the two diverge inside one image. Keep this
# specifier identical to the one there. Two assertions follow: a filename test
# that mirrors the codec gate's deny glob (so a reintroduced libavcodec fails
# here, with a clear message, rather than later in the scan), and a content test
# that enumerates what the shipped FFmpeg libraries actually register.
#
# Reading the content test's output: for 2.2.0 it reports "0 decoders, 0
# encoders" and prints every entry of its "expected present (sanity check)"
# block as ABSENT. That is the correct answer here, not a broken probe -- 2.2.0
# registers no codecs at all, vp9 included. The probe is proved live a different
# way: enumerate_bundled_decoders.py resolves av_codec_iterate through ctypes,
# so a library that does not export it raises AttributeError and fails the
# build rather than reporting a reassuring zero. The check is fail-closed by
# design; if a future release hides that symbol, this stops the build and wants
# a human, which is the right outcome for a check whose whole job is to see
# inside the file.
#
# This deliberately overrides a dependency of TensorRT-LLM's, which is why the
# build log carries a pip resolver complaint here:
#
#     tensorrt-llm 1.3.0rc24 requires PyNvVideoCodec~=2.1.0,
#     but you have pynvvideocodec 2.2.0 which is incompatible
#
# The complaint is expected and the override is deliberate. `~=2.1.0` excludes
# 2.2.0 by construction, and 2.1.0 is the version that bundles the libavcodec.
# tensorrt_llm/media/decoding.py is the only consumer; it uses CreateDemuxer,
# CreateDecoder, PyNvVCException and OutputColorType, all of which 2.2.0 still
# exports, and it imports PyNvVideoCodec function-locally so `import
# tensorrt_llm` does not touch it. Re-check that list when this base image moves:
# if upstream relaxes the pin to allow 2.2.0, this note is the thing to delete.
#
# System interpreter for the same reason as the opencv removal and the DALI
# upgrade above: with VIRTUAL_ENV set, plain pip targets the venv and leaves the
# system-site copy -- the one the scan reads -- in place.
#
# No `import PyNvVideoCodec` smoke test here, deliberately. Unlike nvidia.dali it
# dlopens libnvcuvid and needs NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES to include "video",
# which the builder does not have, so an import check would fail every build.

# Align the base image's aiohttp with the floor requirements.common.txt sets for
# the other Dynamo images. The base ships an older release and the --no-deps
# installs above deliberately leave upstream's solve alone, so this one package is
# raised explicitly. Narrow by design: a single named package, not a re-solve.
#
# System interpreter for the same reason as the opencv removal and the DALI
# upgrade above: with VIRTUAL_ENV set, plain pip targets /opt/dynamo/venv and
# leaves the system-site copy in place. The venv is --system-site-packages, so a
# venv-only install would shadow the old version at import time while leaving it
# on disk under dist-packages, where the image inventory reads it. The guard
# checks the system interpreter specifically, so a venv-only install fails here.
#
# Mirrored by the pre_runtime whiteout below. An upgrade renames the metadata
# directory (aiohttp-3.13.5.dist-info -> aiohttp-3.14.3.dist-info) and the squash
# COPY only replaces paths that match, so without dropping the old tree first the
# base image's dist-info would ship alongside the new one.
#
# Checked against the base's own constraints (datasets, fsspec), which cap nothing
# here. cp312 manylinux_2_28 wheels exist for x86_64 and aarch64, so neither
# architecture builds from source.
# The guard asserts on dist-info directories, not on an importable version,
# because those directories are what an image inventory reads and they are what
# a venv-only install or a missed whiteout would leave wrong. It requires exactly
# one, in range, so a surviving old copy beside the new one fails the build.
# Version-compared rather than glob-matched: a glob range silently stops matching
# at the end of the series it was written for.

# /usr/local/bin/etcd* tools, and preinstalled opencv (cv2/ + vendored
# opencv_python_headless.libs/ + dist-info) would leak alongside our content.
# Keep this list in sync with any deletion RUNs in the stages above.
#
# DALI is here for a different reason: runtime_full UPGRADES it rather than
# removing it, and its vendored libraries are hash-named
# (libavcodec-847b0373.so.62 -> libavcodec-7e11e4e3.so.62). An overlay COPY only
# replaces paths that match, so without dropping the old tree first, the base
# image's 2.1.0 libraries — the ones carrying h264/hevc/aac — would ship
# alongside the upgraded ones and the upgrade would buy nothing.
#
# aiohttp is here for the DALI reason, not the opencv one: runtime_full upgrades
# it in system site, and the version-stamped metadata directory is renamed by the
# upgrade (aiohttp-3.13.5.dist-info -> aiohttp-3.14.3.dist-info). The overlay COPY
# would leave the base image's dist-info beside the new one, and the inventory
# reads that directory, so the upgrade would not show.
#
# PyNvVideoCodec is here for the DALI reason too, and it is the case the codec
# scan actually catches: the scan runs on this stage (compliance_base_stage is
# pre_runtime), not on runtime_full. runtime_full UPGRADES the package, and an
# upgrade is a deletion plus an install -- 2.1.0's libavcodec/libavdevice/
# libavfilter/libswresample/libswscale have no counterpart in 2.2.0, so the
# overlay COPY has nothing to write over them and the base image's copies would
# come straight back. Without this entry the upgrade buys nothing and the scan
# fails exactly as it did before. The version-stamped dist-info is renamed by the
# upgrade (pynvvideocodec-2.1.0.dist-info -> -2.2.0.dist-info), so the glob takes
# that and the stray `pynvvideocodec.` entry beside it.
#
# /usr/local/external/ffmpeg is the same package, in a place that is easy to
# miss: PyNvVideoCodec's wheel installs an FFmpeg source tarball through a
# `../../../external/ffmpeg/src/ffmpeg-<version>.tar.xz` RECORD entry, so it
# lands OUTSIDE dist-packages and the two globs above do not reach it. It is
# version-stamped, so this is the aiohttp rename problem again rather than the
# opencv one: runtime_full's pip upgrade removes ffmpeg-7.0.2.tar.xz and writes
# ffmpeg-8.1.2.tar.xz, the overlay COPY cannot express that deletion, and the
# image would ship BOTH.
#
# Keep the scope of that honest: a source tarball is inert, nothing on the
# runtime path reads it, and the exposure discussed above is in the shipped .so
# files, not here. This entry buys ~10.8 MB and a tree that matches what
# actually ships -- a stale 7.0.2 source sitting beside 8.1.2 binaries invites a
# future reader to conclude the wrong thing about either. The codec scan cannot
# arbitrate: its deny globs match libav*.so*/libsw*.so*, never a .tar.xz, and
# allow_paths lists /usr/local/src/ffmpeg (our in-tree build), not this path.
#
# Delete the directory rather than a single file, and note that the tarball is
# not junk: NOTICES.txt declares LGPLv3 for the bundled FFmpeg, so the source is
# the corresponding-source obligation for the .so files the extension links
# against. That is why the overlay must restore runtime_full's copy -- the point
# is to ship exactly one tarball, the one matching the shipped binaries, not to
# ship none.
#
# Its runtime dependencies are listed for the same reason. pip upgrades those too
# when the new aiohttp requires versions the base does not carry, and each rename
# has the same doubling problem. Dropping them here is free: the overlay restores
# whatever runtime_full holds, so listing one that did not move costs nothing and
# omitting one that did would leave stale metadata behind.
