"""Explicit installer for backend media-decoder packages.

Dynamo's runtime images ship a deliberately narrow media stack: the in-tree
FFmpeg is built for VP8/VP9 video (VP9 output), and the wider backend decode
packages are not pre-installed. That keeps the distributed images small and
their input-format surface narrow by default.

Two input classes already work without this module. VP8/VP9 decode through the
in-tree FFmpeg, and H.264/H.265 decode on the GPU through NVDEC
(``common.multimodal.nvdec_decoder``), which every backend routes to by default.

This module covers what is left:

* compressed audio (AAC and friends), which NVDEC does not decode at all, and
* H.264/H.265 on hosts where NVDEC is unavailable -- a GPU with no video decode
  engine, or a container not granted the ``video`` driver capability.

Each backend decodes such input through a specific Python package whose wheel
bundles its own FFmpeg, so the support can be added by a plain ``pip install``
-- no image rebuild:

* vLLM video input    -> OpenCV (``cv2``),    package ``opencv-python-headless``
* vLLM audio input    -> PyAV (``av``),       package ``av``
* SGLang video input  -> decord (``decord``), package ``decord2``
* TRT-LLM video input -> OpenCV (``cv2``),    package ``opencv-python-headless``

Nothing here runs implicitly. There is no environment switch and no startup
hook: the operator runs the installer as a deliberate step --

    python -m dynamo.common.utils.install_media_decoders vllm

-- so a deployment that changes the image's codec surface says so where it can
be seen (a Dockerfile RUN line, a pod command, a runbook step), not in an
environment variable three layers of tooling away. Installing these packages
broadens the codec surface of the running container; review that against your
organization's distribution and security policies before rolling it out.

Each package installs at a version validated against Dynamo's multimodal test
suite (see the specs below): the lower bound is the exact validated version and
the upper bound excludes the next major, so a fresh install cannot silently
pick up an unvalidated release. This installer deliberately covers ONLY those
tested combinations; to pin different versions or install a custom subset, run
pip directly with the tool of your choice (see the docs for the equivalent
commands).

The default install runs with ``--no-deps`` so it cannot change the image's
pinned dependency stack (e.g. numpy under torch/vLLM); the carriers need only
numpy, which the backend already provides. The install is idempotent (skipped
when the module already imports), serialized across processes with a file
lock, and bounded by a timeout so a stalled index cannot hang forever. The
encode path (video output) is unaffected and stays on the in-tree FFmpeg. The
optional Rust frontend decoder links FFmpeg's compiled-in decoders and is
therefore not extended by an install here -- backend decode is.

For air-gapped or allowlisted-network hosts, point pip at a local wheelhouse:

    python -m dynamo.common.utils.install_media_decoders vllm \\
        --pip-args="--no-index --find-links /wheels"
