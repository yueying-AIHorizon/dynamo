"""Exporter ports for NIXL telemetry when several ranks share one pod.

NIXL's Prometheus exporter binds one fixed TCP port, read from
``NIXL_TELEMETRY_PROMETHEUS_PORT`` when the NIXL agent is constructed, so a
backend that builds one agent per co-located rank needs one port per rank.
The port is derived as ``base + local_rank`` rather than left ephemeral
because it has to be predictable: the operator declares the whole range as
container ports and the PodMonitor scrapes each one by name. NIXL accepts
``0`` and binds an ephemeral port, but exposes no accessor for the port it
actually got, so nothing could name that port as a scrape target.

This module deliberately imports no inference engine: the derivation is pure
arithmetic over a base port and a rank index, and the callers that know how to
find a rank index live in the per-backend packages.
