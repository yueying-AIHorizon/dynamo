"""Read media bytes from the non-HTTP sources the hardware decoder can use.

``fetch_bytes`` only speaks HTTP(S), so ``file://`` and ``data:`` media never
produced bytes at the routing layer and could not reach NVDEC -- they fell
through to the software decoder instead. The codec-compliant runtime images
ship no software video decoder, so that fallback no longer resolves and those
schemes lost video support entirely. This module supplies the missing bytes so
H.264/H.265 from a local file or a data URI decodes on the GPU like any other
source.

``file://`` stays behind ``validate_local_path``: local access is refused
unless ``DYN_MM_LOCAL_PATH`` is set, paths are resolved before the prefix check
(so symlinks cannot escape), and this adds no read surface beyond what the
existing media connectors already allow under the same policy.
