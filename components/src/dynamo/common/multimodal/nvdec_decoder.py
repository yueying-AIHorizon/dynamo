"""GPU (NVDEC) video decode for H.264/H.265 via PyNvVideoCodec.

Dual-path companion to the VP8/VP9 in-tree FFmpeg decoders. Royalty-free codecs
(VP8/VP9/AV1) stay on the existing CPU path; H.264/H.265 decode on the GPU
through NVDEC, which links ``libnvcuvid`` at runtime and carries no bundled
software codec. NVDEC does not use SMs beyond a small YUV->RGB conversion, so the
inference-time impact is minimal.

This module is backend-agnostic. Each backend's decode site (vLLM ``VideoLoader``,
TRT-LLM ``multimodal_processor``, SGLang encode worker) routes on the probed codec:

    codec = probe_video_codec(video_bytes)
    if should_use_nvdec(codec):
        frames, meta = decode_video_nvdec(video_bytes, num_frames)
    else:
        frames, meta = <existing decoder>

The returned frames match the existing ``VideoLoader`` contract: a host numpy
array of shape ``(T, H, W, 3)``, dtype ``uint8``, RGB, C-contiguous, plus a
metadata dict ``{"fps", "frames_indices", "total_num_frames"}``.

Gating: NVDEC is used when PyNvVideoCodec is importable and ``DYN_DISABLE_NVDEC``
is not set. When it is unavailable (CPU image, unsupported profile) the caller
raises the actionable unsupported-codec error built by
``common.multimodal.codec_errors``.
