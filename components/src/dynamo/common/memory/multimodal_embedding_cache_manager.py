Encoder Cache Manager

A simple LRU cache for encoder embeddings (tensors).
Maps content hash keys to tensors with capacity-based eviction.

Usage:
    cache = MultimodalEmbeddingCacheManager(capacity_bytes=4 * 1024**3)  # 4GB

    # Store embedding
    cache.set("abc123", embedding_tensor)

    # Retrieve embedding
    tensor = cache.get("abc123")  # Returns None if not found

        Decide admission for an entry of ``size_bytes`` and evict to fit it.

        Takes a byte count rather than a tensor so a caller that has to
        allocate the tensor itself — a device copy, say — can learn that the
        entry will be rejected, and can have the room for it freed, before it
        pays for the allocation. Nothing is reserved: ``_current_bytes`` is
        only reduced by what this evicts, so a caller whose allocation then
        fails leaks no capacity, and the subsequent ``set()`` still does its
        own accounting and finds its eviction loop with nothing left to do.

        An entry already stored under ``key`` is dropped here rather than
        counted as a refund against ``set_with_delta()``, which would replace
        it later. Merely deducting its bytes would keep its storage alive
        across the caller's allocation, so a full cache would still peak at its
        capacity plus the new entry — the one thing this method exists to
        prevent. It is not counted as an eviction, because nothing was
        displaced for want of capacity; the entry is on its way out either way.
        A caller that then abandons the store leaves that key uncached, which
        costs a later miss and no memory. Because the key is gone by the time
        ``set_with_delta()`` runs, it reports the store as an addition rather
        than a replacement.

        Args:
            key: Cache key the caller intends to store under.
            size_bytes: Size in bytes of the entry the caller intends to store.

        Returns:
            CacheReservation reporting whether the entry can be stored at all,
            plus the keys evicted to make room for it. A dropped entry under
            ``key`` is not among them.
