"""Filtering semantics of the typed engine-metrics contract.

Whether the typed form carries what the engines actually emit is asserted
end to end against live deployments -- see ``MetricsPayload`` in
``tests/utils/payloads.py``, which runs against real vLLM, SGLang and
TensorRT-LLM. Constructed registries cannot answer that question honestly,
since they only contain shapes someone thought to write down.

What is left here is the part a real engine cannot exercise: which filter
inputs select which families.

    The text form matches each rendered *line*, so its names carry the

    used (``vllm:``, ``sglang:``, ``trtllm_``, ``python_``, ``process_``) both
    agree, because family and sample names share the prefix.

    They diverge only for a filter naming a suffixed sample. Family-level is
