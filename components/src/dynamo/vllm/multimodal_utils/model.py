    Resolution proceeds in two stages: a `config.json` `architectures`
    lookup when `model_name` is a local directory with config (authoritative
    when present), falling through to a lowercased substring scan against
    per-family name patterns (`qwen2-vl`, `qwen3-vl`, `llava-1.5-7b-hf`).
    Patterns are family-level prefixes, so HF ids, HF cache layouts, and
    hand-rolled local paths are all handled by the same scan, and new
    sizes / quantizations of an existing family resolve without a registry
    change.

    Args:
        model_name: A model identifier. Accepts an HF id, an HF cache
            snapshot path, or a local directory path (with or without
            `config.json`, with or without an HF-cache-style parent
            segment).

    Returns:
        The matching `ModelFamily`, or `None` if no registered family
        matches the input.

    Examples:
        All of the following resolve to `ModelFamily.QWEN_VL`:

        >>> resolve_model_family("Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct")

        >>> resolve_model_family("/runs/qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct/v3")

        A local directory containing `config.json` with

        via the metadata stage regardless of the directory's name.

    This is a WORKAROUND (WAR) for vLLM's disaggregated multimodal decode limitations.

    Notes:
    - vLLM parses multimodal inputs and builds `mm_features` from `multi_modal_data`.
    - For Qwen VL models, the parser enforces that image data contains BOTH
      `image_embeds` and `image_grid_thw` keys.
    - In disaggregated decode, the KV cache already includes the vision context
      from prefill; decode still needs `mm_features` for mRoPE initialization.

    WAR Details:
    - We generate unique placeholder embeddings based on request_id to prevent
      incorrect prefix cache matches between different images with same dimensions.
    - Without this, zero embeddings + same image_grid_thw would create identical
      cache signatures, causing decode to incorrectly reuse cached KV from
      different images.

    Caching Caveat:
    - This WAR disables prefix cache reuse on the DECODE worker (each request
      has unique placeholder embeddings).
    - Prefix caching still works correctly on the PREFILL worker, which uses
      actual image embeddings. This is where the caching benefit matters since
      prefill does the heavy computation.
    - Decode receives KV blocks from prefill via NIXL transfer anyway, so
      decode-side prefix caching provides minimal benefit in disaggregated setup.
