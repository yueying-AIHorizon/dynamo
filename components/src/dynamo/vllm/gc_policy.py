"""GC pause mitigation for FPM self-benchmarking.

CPython gen2 (full) collections walk every tracked object and trigger on
the 25% long-lived-growth rule, so their pauses grow with the heap: over a
30k-point benchmark sweep we measured pauses rising from ~0.4s to ~9s at
geometrically spaced iteration indices (ratio ~1.23), inside the vLLM
worker processes. Under TP/DP lockstep a single worker's pause stalls the
whole forward pass, and with the scheduler's host-side wall_time it lands
in the measured latency as a 3-200x outlier.

``gc.freeze()`` moves currently tracked objects into the permanent
generation, excluding them from future collections: after a periodic
freeze, gen2 only walks objects allocated since the previous tick, so the
pause is bounded by the allocation rate instead of total heap size.
The policy's only goal is keeping GC pauses out of measured wall_time:
automatic gen2 collections are disabled entirely and the periodic tick
only freezes (no traversal, no pause). Cyclic garbage is therefore NOT
reclaimed while the policy is active - acceptable for benchmark sweeps;
long-running processes can reclaim it by calling :func:`gc_maintain`
from an untimed window.

The policy is env-gated and off by default:

  DYN_FPM_GC_POLICY=freeze        enable the periodic freeze loop
  DYN_FPM_GC_FREEZE_INTERVAL_S=60 tick interval in seconds

Coverage:
  * worker processes  - pass ``--worker-extension-cls
    dynamo.vllm.gc_policy.FpmGcWorkerExtension``; resolving the class
    imports this module inside every worker, which auto-starts the
    policy (no collective_rpc required). The RPC methods remain
    available for explicit control.
  * engine-core process - ``InstrumentedScheduler`` imports this module,
    calls :func:`start_gc_policy` when benchmarking starts, and
    :func:`stop_gc_policy` when it deactivates.
