    """Deployment-control interface the planner uses to inspect and scale one deployment.

    ``construct_connector`` selects one implementation per
    ``PlannerConfig.environment``: ``KubernetesConnector`` scales through the DGD
    scaling adapter's ``Scale`` subresource and falls back to patching DGD replica
    counts directly when no adapter exists, ``VirtualConnector`` publishes
    decisions through the runtime coordinator for the deployment environment to
    apply, and ``GlobalPlannerConnector`` forwards them to a centralized
    GlobalPlanner.
    ``PlannerEnvironmentImpl.initialize`` drives ``async_init``, then
    ``validate_deployment``, then ``wait_for_deployment_ready``; ``async_init``
    has to run first, because ``GlobalPlannerConnector.set_component_replicas``
    raises ``RuntimeError`` until it holds a remote client.

    A clean return is not proof of the outcome. ``validate_deployment`` inspects
    the deployment only under Kubernetes and is a no-op in the other two modes.
    ``get_gpu_shapes`` yields ``(None, None)`` from ``VirtualConnector`` always
    and from ``GlobalPlannerConnector`` when it holds no pool-local Kubernetes
    connector, while the Kubernetes implementation raises
    ``DeploymentValidationError`` rather than reporting an unknown shape.
    ``get_gpu_counts`` remains a compatibility view of per-engine width.
    ``get_model_name`` can return the placeholder
    ``"managed-remotely"`` under a global planner.
    ``set_component_replicas`` may log and return without scaling when the
    deployment is not ready or the global planner rejects the request, though all
    three implementations do raise ``EmptyTargetReplicasError`` on an empty target
    list. ``get_actual_worker_counts`` reports ``0`` for a component whose name
    argument is ``None`` rather than a deployment-wide total.

    Being a ``Protocol`` rather than an ABC, every method body here is ``pass``.
    All three implementations subclass it explicitly, so an override that is
    missing or misnamed returns ``None`` at runtime instead of raising. The
    surface callers rely on is also wider than what is declared here:
    ``construct_environment`` feature-detects ``get_worker_runtime_namespace``,
    which all three connectors provide.
