# Dynamo EPP on-ramp for vanilla vLLM

This directory contains raw Kubernetes manifests for an on-ramp that runs Dynamo's
Endpoint Picker Plugin (EPP) behind Gateway API Inference Extension (GAIE) with stock `vllm serve`
pods. It does not install the Dynamo operator, create a `DynamoGraphDeployment`, or run Dynamo's
NATS/JetStream event plane.

For the user-facing walkthrough, start with
[Vanilla vLLM GAIE On-ramp](../../../../../docs/fern/pages/kubernetes/kv-aware-routing/vanilla-vllm-onramp.mdx).

## How the on-ramp works

This on-ramp is available for aggregated serving only at this time.

Replace `<VLLM_IMAGE>` in `agg.yaml` with the vLLM image your platform uses, including its release
tag or digest. Use a digest for reproducible deployments.
KV-aware selection is provided by the runtime-free
[selection service](../../../../../docs/fern/pages/developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/router/standalone-selection.md),
which the EPP runs **in-process**: the EPP and the selection service are compiled into one binary,
so there is no separate selector Deployment and no HTTP hop. The EPP can run single-replica, or
**replicated** with cross-replica active-load sync between EPP pods (see
[Replicated mode](../../../../../docs/fern/pages/kubernetes/kv-aware-routing/vanilla-vllm-onramp.mdx#epp-replication)).

Whether the EPP uses the Dynamo runtime or not is controlled with the `DYN_EPP_MODE` environment
variable: `dynamo` uses the Dynamo runtime, while `standalone` runs the runtime-free selection
service in-process. Standalone mode uses the standard Rust EPP binary. Because the first Dynamo
release containing standalone mode has not been published yet, build the EPP from the current source
revision and push it to a registry that every cluster node can pull from:

```bash
export EPP_IMAGE=registry.example.com/your-project/dynamo-epp:standalone

make -C ../.. IMAGE_TAG="$EPP_IMAGE" image-push
```

```yaml
- name: DYN_EPP_MODE
  value: "standalone"
```

The EPP watches ready vLLM pods in the `InferencePool`, subscribes to native vLLM KV cache events,
tokenizes prompts for routing, and returns the selected endpoint to the gateway.

## What Dynamo-managed GAIE adds

- Disaggregated prefill/decode (Disaggregated serving is planned follow-up in the standalone mode.)
- Operator-managed lifecycle for Workers, Services, `InferencePool`, and EPP resources.
- Request migration, rejection, cancellation - overall admission control
- Data parallelism (The standalone mode which targets DP=1.)
- Cross-replica KV-index warm-up when new replica re-warms from live traffic + replay.
- Initial worker cache-state synchronization instead of rebuilding the index only from live traffic.
- Per-tenant KV cache isolation with x-tenant-id / cache_salt. This requires per-engine support and as such is not supported in the Standalone mode.
- Management of Transient disconnects. In the Dynamo mode the KV-cache updates the worker sent during the gap are recovered from the worker's **replay** socket when `DYN_EPP_KV_EVENT_REPLAY_PORT` is set (and the vLLM worker exposes one); otherwise the index refreshes from new traffic.
- Dropped events / gaps management. The `SelectionCore` indexer does seq-watermark gap detection and replays missed events from the worker's replay socket when `DYN_EPP_KV_EVENT_REPLAY_PORT` is configured. Without a replay socket, gaps are dropped and the index re-warms from new traffic.
- Multi-modal support
- Topology / Zone aware routing
- Speculative Decoding awareness
- Session affinity
- Full list of OpenAI HTTP endpoints
- Metrics/observability

## How it works

1. The EPP reads the `InferencePool` it backs to learn the pod
   selector and HTTP target port — the same object the gateway routes to — and
   watches those pods, Ready-filtered.
2. For each Ready pod, the EPP registers a worker into its **in-process**
   selector with the pod's endpoint, block size, and KV-event socket.
3. The selector subscribes directly to each pod's KV-cache event socket and
   maintains the KV index, scheduler, and load accounting.
4. On each request the EPP sends the unchanged body to the configured vLLM
   `/v1/chat/completions/render` endpoint, uses the returned tokens to select a
   currently-Ready worker (booking its load via select-and-reserve), and returns
   the worker's endpoint to Envoy as routing headers. The selected
   worker processes the original forwarded request.
