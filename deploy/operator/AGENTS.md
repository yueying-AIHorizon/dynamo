- RBAC changes for operator code must update the `+kubebuilder:rbac` markers.
- Run `make manifests` to regenerate the platform chart's
  `../helm/charts/platform/components/operator/files/role.yaml`.
- Keep chart-only grants in the manual section of the platform chart's
  `../helm/charts/platform/components/operator/templates/manager-rbac.yaml`.

## Reconciliation and Admission Semantics

- Reconciler state convergence must be level-based. Derive actions from desired
  and observed state on every invocation; never depend on the request operation
  or informer event edge to determine what to do.
- Kubernetes Event emission is intentionally edge-based. Derive these edges
  from explicit object state, such as a spec/status difference or a durable
  annotation, never from informer delivery semantics.
- An operator-only upgrade must not roll or materially alter unchanged
  workloads unless an explicit, documented migration or opt-in requires it.
- Admission validation should enforce state invariants independent of the
  request operation. Distinguish between `CREATE` and `UPDATE` only for
  exceptional, intentional API semantics, and document why the distinction is
  required.

## Go Code Style

- Put a one-line story comment above every multi-line block of logically
  connected code.
- Separate multi-line semantic blocks from surrounding code with one blank
  line. Do not add trailing blank lines before a closing delimiter or between
  a block-leading comment and its code.
- Getter, resolver, renderer, converter, and hash functions must not mutate
  their inputs unless mutation is an explicit, documented part of the contract.
- Avoid forwarding helpers that merely rename or wrap one call. Test-only
  static resolvers and convenience helpers belong in `_test.go` files, not
  production code.
- Do not add production fields, types, or extension points solely for
  hypothetical future use.
- An extension point introduced for testability must also be used by production
  code. Tests may override the value or implementation supplied through that
  production path; do not add a parallel test-only extension point.

## Function Preconditions and Nil Handling

- Treat pointer inputs as non-nil by default. Document non-nil preconditions in
  the function's Go doc.
- A function may accept `nil` only when this is explicitly supported as part of
  its domain semantics, such as a mode that does not require the argument.
  Document the supported `nil` cases in the function's Go doc.
- Do not defensively check pointer inputs for `nil` unless `nil` has an explicit
  domain meaning.
- When `nil` is not such a supported domain value, callers must establish the
  non-nil precondition before calling the function.
- If a function validates caller-provided input, return an error for invalid
  values. Do not disguise an invalid call by returning a zero value.
- Do not overload a zero value to mean "not found" when absence must be
  distinguished from a valid zero value. Return an explicit presence boolean
  alongside the value, for example:
  `func NestedValue(x any, path ...string) (value any, found bool)`.
- Getters and transformation functions must not translate a `nil` input into a
  zero value by default. Do so only when nil-tolerant behavior is an intentional,
  documented API convention, such as JSON-path-style getters.

## Go Test Style

- Use `t.Log` to tell the test's story, with one heading before each block that
  implements a test step. Preserve test paragraph comments by converting them
  to `t.Log` headings when moving or refactoring the code.
- Keep test fixtures in local variables or constants and owned by one test.
- Avoid hiding bespoke test logic in closures. Reserve closures for standard
  helpers such as `Eventually`.
- Prefer a shared construction DSL over shared fixture objects when setup is
  complex or repetitive; the DSL should describe the object at a high level.
- Prefer table tests over one-off tests and do not duplicate behavior already
  covered by a table.
