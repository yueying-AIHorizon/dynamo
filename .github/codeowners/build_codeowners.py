"""Validate CODEOWNERS coverage against a live tree (repo-agnostic).

Reads an ``areas.yaml`` (each area declares its path globs directly), asks the
pure resolver in ``codeowners_match`` what the emitted CODEOWNERS would cover,
and reports how much of the live tree is EXPLICITLY owned vs. falls to the
catch-all. It also rejects stale globs (all of them in full-tree runs; in
diff-aware runs, the ones this branch itself orphaned) and verifies that final
last-match resolution retains every owner promised by required and blocking
file-type declarations.

This is the ONLY place in the pipeline that reads ``git ls-files``. Emission
is a pure function of the policy YAML; the tree only enters here, in the
``--strict`` gate that asserts every tracked file matches some non-catch-all
rule. The gate and the emitted file share the same resolver, so a file the
gate accepts is a file the emitter has a rule for.

Usage:
  uv run python .github/codeowners/build_codeowners.py \\
      --areas .github/codeowners/areas.yaml --repo . [--strict]

    Rows a later rule overrides for a given path are skipped: the shared row is
