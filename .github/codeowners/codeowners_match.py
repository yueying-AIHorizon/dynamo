"""Canonical CODEOWNERS matcher + resolution pipeline (single source of truth).

The CODEOWNERS pipeline used to have three subtly-different path matchers --
one in `build_codeowners.py` for coverage gating, byte-identical copies in
`emit_codeowners.py` and `who_owns.py` for routing. Coverage and routing could
disagree, and nothing cross-checked them. Everything in the pipeline now goes
through `match()` here so the gate and the artifact are forced to agree.

Emission is a PURE FUNCTION of the policy YAML: ``compute_resolution(spec)``
takes only the parsed ``areas.yaml`` and returns the model that ``emit`` uses,
with no ``git ls-files`` in the loop. The tree is read exactly once, in the
``--strict`` coverage gate of ``build_codeowners.py``, to assert that every
tracked file matches a non-catch-all rule. Same policy in -> byte-identical
CODEOWNERS out, no matter what the checked-out tree looks like.

This module exposes:

  - ``match(pattern, path) -> bool`` -- canonical GitHub CODEOWNERS matcher.
  - ``resolve_owners(rules, path) -> list[str]`` -- last-match-wins resolution.
  - ``parse_codeowners(text) -> list[(pattern, owners)]`` -- shared parser.
  - ``anchor(glob) -> str`` -- repo-root anchoring helper.
  - ``compute_resolution(spec) -> ResolvedModel`` -- pure, tree-independent
    resolution used by both ``build_codeowners.py`` and ``emit_codeowners.py``.
  - ``load_tree(repo)`` -- ``git ls-files`` helper (``--strict`` gate only).
  - ``minimal_cover(file_team, catch_all)`` -- legacy min-cost last-match
    cover, kept for external callers; NOT used by the emitter anymore.
  - Typed shapes (``Area``, ``SharedSpec``, ``FiletypeRule``,
    ``ResolvedArea``, ``FiletypeShared``, ``ResolvedModel``).

GitHub CODEOWNERS semantics implemented here:

  * ``*``                  -- catch-all.
  * ``/foo/``              -- anchored directory subtree.
  * ``/foo`` (no wildcards)-- exact anchored path.
  * ``/foo/*.rs``          -- anchored glob; ``*``/``?`` stop at ``/``,
    ``**`` crosses directories (as GitHub resolves them).
  * ``foo/``               -- unanchored directory; matches any subtree named
    ``foo/`` at any depth.
  * ``*.md`` / ``Dockerfile`` (no slash) -- basename glob at any depth.
  * any with ``/`` and wildcards -- full-path glob, same ``*`` semantics.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Kept exported for external callers that still want a tree-aware minimal
# cover. The CODEOWNERS emitter no longer calls it: whichever rule set the
# cover picks depends on the exact tree, so unrelated file adds/moves on
# ``main`` used to churn the emitted CODEOWNERS for PRs that touched none
# of them. Emission now renders declared ``path_globs`` verbatim.


def minimal_cover(file_team: dict[str, str], catch_all: str) -> list[tuple[str, str]]:
    """Smallest set of base rules reproducing ``file_team`` under last-match.

    Returns ``(anchored_pattern, team)`` pairs: directory globs covering whole
    subtrees plus file globs for in-directory exceptions. The catch-all is
    the root default and is NOT returned. Emit shortest-path-first (or
    grouped, with deeper rules after) so a more-specific rule still wins.

    Legacy: the CODEOWNERS emitter no longer calls this, because the choice
    of cover depends on the tree and thus makes CODEOWNERS non-deterministic
    against unrelated churn on the base branch.
