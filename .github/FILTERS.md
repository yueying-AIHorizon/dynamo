# CI Filters

The `filters.yaml` file controls which CI jobs run based on changed files.

## How It Works

When you open a PR, CI checks which files changed and runs only relevant jobs:

| Filter                                                  | Triggers                                                                                                                                                                             |

> [!NOTE]
> `ignore` doesn't directly trigger CI jobs.
> It exists to satisfy coverage requirements - every file must match at least one filter.
> Sidecar source and proto files also match `rust`, so the existing workspace Rust checks cover sidecar tests before the image is built and published.
> `docs` gates the Docs Lint, Fern Configuration Check, Docs Website Composition Check, and Fern Broken Links Check jobs in `pre-merge.yml`.
> `examples` gates Recipe Check.

> [!TODO]
> The sidecar image also consumes root Cargo files, shared libraries, and composite actions.
> Expanding the filter to cover every remaining build input is deferred until the additional PR CI fan-out is evaluated and agreed.

## Fixing "Uncovered Files" Errors

If CI fails with:
```
ERROR: The following files are not covered by any CI filter
```

Add patterns to `filters.yaml`:

1. **New source files** → Add to `core` or relevant backend filter
2. **New examples, recipes, and recipe validation helpers** → Add to `examples`
3. **Fern docs-site content** (anything under `docs/fern/`) → Add to `docs`
4. **Markdown elsewhere in the repo** (a `lib/` or `container/` README) → Add to `ignore`.
   It is documentation, but the Fern site does not read it, and `docs` gates four jobs
   including the composition check.
5. **Config files that don't need CI** → Add to `ignore`

## Testing Locally

```bash
cd .github/scripts
npm install
npm run coverage  # Check if all repo files are covered
```

## Pattern Syntax

- `**` matches any path depth (but not dotfiles by default)
- `*` matches within a directory
- `!pattern` excludes files (used in `core` to skip docs)
- For dotfiles, add explicit pattern like `dir/.*`

Example: `lib/**/*.rs` matches all Rust files under `lib/`.

## Adding a New Filter Group

If you create a new filter in `filters.yaml`, you must also update the shared
changed-files action so the coverage check knows about it:

1. Add the filter to `filters.yaml`.
2. Edit `.github/actions/changed-files/action.yml`:
   - Expose the new filter as an output (see the existing `core`, `planner`,
     `vllm`, `sglang`, `trtllm`, etc. entries at the top of the file).
   - Add its `*_all_modified_files` to the `COVERED_FILES` line in the
     "Check for uncovered files" step.

If you skip this step, CI will fail with "uncovered files" even though your filter exists.
