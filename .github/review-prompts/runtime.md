# Runtime codeowner review

Review the proposed change for runtime defects. Read the diff and surrounding code to establish what the change affects. Concentrate on changed runtime, transport, discovery, Rust/Python binding, and shared backend code assigned to the runtime group. Follow directly affected callers and callees to establish behavior; do not scan unrelated code or assume every concern below applies.

## Error propagation and admission

1. Trace errors from their origin through serialization, acknowledgments, response-stream
   prologues, deserialization, and the caller's retry decision. Verify that overload,
   cancellation, and unavailable-worker errors retain the distinctions the actual caller
   requires. A correctly typed local error is insufficient if a later boundary turns it into an
   unrelated type or a string that its consumer never interprets.

2. Check the actual transport paths before claiming that TCP and NATS have equivalent behavior:
   admission can occur after an upstream semaphore or response-stream allocation, so its
   effective capacity and retained resources depend on that ordering. Report only a concrete
   consequence supported by the changed path and its callers.

## Discovery and lifecycle

3. When discovery or worker availability changes, distinguish an uninitialized discovery source
   from an authoritative empty snapshot. Trace removal of the final worker, stale scheduler
   candidates, and subsequent restoration. Check whether removed or expired state continues to
   affect selection or imposes repeated work on every request.

4. Inspect the lifetime and ownership of the changed request state, permits, buffers, and tasks
   across errors and early termination; identify a reachable leak, stale-state use, or incorrect
   release before reporting it.

5. Distinguish explicit runtime shutdown from object destruction: a detached cancellation token
   reached only by Drop can leave a listener accepting after shutdown when Python still holds the
   runtime object.

6. Preserve the intended drain ordering when checking how listeners eventually stop. A
   momentarily empty channel does not prove a drain is complete while producers can still send;
   verify that shutdown first stops admission and then accounts for already accepted work.

## Performance

7. Inspect performance impact on inference request and response paths using the implementation
   and any supplied calculations or measurements. If more evidence is needed to establish a
   suspected regression, ask the PR author for the relevant calculations or measurements;
   do not undertake inference benchmarking during review. Check performance changes against
   all supported callers of the changed helper.
   Buffer reuse can increase allocations for one-frame responses or for callers that still
   require an owned vector. A conversion that returns a copy is not a no-op merely because the
   input already has the requested format.

8. Look for new per-request allocations, locks, clock reads, or scans whose concrete cost follows
   from the implementation, especially when state could instead be updated when discovery
   changes. Do not demand a benchmark or a preferred design as a finding without establishing a
   regression in a supported path.

## Python and Rust interfaces

9. Follow public options and types across Python signatures, bindings, Rust configuration, and
   their actual consumers. Preserve the established positional argument prefix unless the change
   explicitly and consistently revises that contract.

10. An accepted option must reach the component that implements it or be rejected where
    unsupported. Check that runtime construction and bridge initialization actually use the
    configured runtime or thread count.

11. Before alleging a compatibility break, inspect the declaration and supported callers; do not
    turn naming, typing style, or an intentional staged migration into a defect.

## HTTP media fetching

12. For changes to shared HTTP media fetching, trace the actual outbound connection rather than
    stopping at initial URL validation. Check redirects, proxy routing, DNS resolution, connect
    deadlines, TLS hostname verification, and per-call policy wherever the diff changes those
    behaviors. A validator cannot protect a fetch performed by another client that bypasses it.

13. Preserve logical hostname and policy identity when pooling connections or pinning dial
    addresses, and confirm the documented behavior of the pinned HTTP library before reporting a
    bypass or regression.

## Runtime observability

14. For runtime telemetry changes, verify that metric-family metadata is committed only when the
    corresponding family is accepted, and that rejected duplicates cannot change a surviving
    family's type or unit.

15. Check that asynchronous spans receive their intended parent when constructed; entering a span
    only when a future is polled does not reparent an already-created child. Report demonstrably
    incorrect classification, exported data, or parentage, rather than requesting additional
    instrumentation that the pull request explicitly defers.

## Test evidence

16. Verify that added or changed tests exercise the functionality being changed and can
    distinguish the relevant regression. Prefer the smallest set of cases that preserves
    distinct supported outcomes; before recommending consolidation, identify the retained test
    and the behavior it still covers.

## Reporting findings

Report as findings only high-confidence, actionable defects introduced by the change. Treat these concerns as directions for investigation, not mandatory findings. Exclude summaries, praise, style preferences, speculative failures, unrelated existing problems, and requests for tests without an identified behavioral defect from findings. When review history is available, read the discussion and author explanations, verify them against the code, and account for withdrawn concerns and explicitly staged follow-ups. Do not post a duplicate finding for an underlying defect already raised there. Separately note previously reported defects that you verify remain present, referencing the original discussion; distinguish them from fixed or unverified concerns. Keep one finding per underlying defect.

For each finding, identify the file and relevant lines, explain the triggering condition and concrete consequence, and describe the narrow correction. Verify any identifiers or replacement code you propose, including relevant ownership and lifetime constraints. If no new defect qualifies, state that no new findings were identified. This does not establish that previously reported defects are fixed or that the change is ready to approve.

When a suspected inference-path regression requires evidence from the author, include a short "Questions for the author" block separate from findings. Identify the affected supported path and the calculation or measurement needed to assess the suspected regression; do not present the question as a confirmed defect.
