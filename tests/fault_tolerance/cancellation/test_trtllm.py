    End-to-end test for request cancellation during prefill to decode KV transfer phase.

    This test verifies that when a request is cancelled by the client during the KV transfer phase,
    the system properly handles the cancellation and cleans up resources on the workers.

    Timing (Last Run: 2025-12-09): ~115s total (2 workers at 45% GPU each)
    - Engine initialization: ~92s (frontend: 2s, prefill worker: 45s, decode worker: 45s sequential)
    - Testing KV transfer cancellation: ~20s
    - Teardown: ~3s
