"""End-to-end tests for MM-aware KV routing with the Rust frontend (mm-routing).

Architecture:
  Frontend (Rust preprocessor + KV router)
       └─ resolves <|image_pad|>, computes per-image N,
          expands placeholders, hashes URL→u64→64-char hex,
          forwards mm_hashes via extra_args["mm_hashes"]
       → vLLM worker (publishes KV events with the forwarded UUID)

These tests assert that:
  1. Same-image repeats see >1 block of router-side overlap and high
     vLLM cached_tokens (the bit-exact MM cache hit).
  2. The data: URI path works equivalently to http URLs.
  3. Different images on the same prompt produce strictly less overlap
     than identical-image repeats.

The fallback path (model unsupported by the image-processor registry or image-token
unresolvable) is unit-tested via `image_token::tests` and the
graceful-degrade branches in `gather_mm_exact_routing_info`; reproducing
it e2e would require a model whose loading is heavy and whose worker
support is fragile (e.g. Phi-4-multimodal-instruct + trust_remote_code),
so we cover that path at the Rust unit-test boundary.
