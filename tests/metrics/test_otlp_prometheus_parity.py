"""`/metrics` and OTLP must show the same metrics in a real run.

The two surfaces are fed by independent callbacks -- the scrape appends the
engine's exposition text, the export takes the same metrics typed -- so nothing
in the type system stops them drifting apart. A metric that reaches one and not
the other is the failure this pins: it looks fine on a dashboard scraping
Prometheus while silently missing from the collector, or the reverse.

Runs against a real worker process rather than a constructed registry, because
drift shows up in wiring (a callback registered on one path only, an exporter
gated behind something that is off by default), not in the mapper.
