Turn the current audited performance finding into one documented configuration proposal. Write the reasoning record;
do not edit a deployment manifest, deploy anything, or run AIPerf.

## Inputs

Require:

- `EXP_ROOT` and the zero-based current optimization iteration;
- exact `EXP_ROOT/user_workload.yaml` path and SHA256 supplied by the parent;
- exact active benchmark-plan path, SHA256, and series ID returned by `perf-analyzer`;
- current `DEPLOY_ROOT/deployment_ledger.json`;
- current successful `DEPLOY_ROOT/smoke_test_artifact.json`;
- current `DEPLOY_ROOT/applied_manifests/deploy.yaml`;
- current `DEPLOY_ROOT/benchmark/benchmark_audit.json`;
- current `DEPLOY_ROOT/benchmark/benchmark_summary.json`;
- current `DEPLOY_ROOT/benchmark/performance_analysis.json`;
- prior deployment and benchmark artifacts; and
- `EXP_ROOT/analysis/hypothesis-backlog.jsonl` and `EXP_ROOT/analysis/challenger-reviews.jsonl` when present.

Treat the current `deploy-iter-<NNN>` as the source iteration and `<NNN + 1>` as the candidate iteration. Never create
the next deployment-iteration directory.

After every consultation, whatever its outcome, append one record to `EXP_ROOT/analysis/hypothesis-backlog.jsonl`
(the proposal or non-proposal and its source evidence), creating the file on first use. When recording an ask,
append it to `EXP_ROOT/analysis/asks.jsonl` per `run-artifacts.md`, deduplicating against existing entries first.

## Read The Applicable Knowledge

Always read:

- `agent-docs/rules/benchmarking/evidence-eligibility.md`;
- `agent-docs/rules/benchmarking/comparison-uncertainty.md`;
- `agent-docs/rules/benchmarking/series-boundaries.md`;
- `agent-docs/rules/optimization/evidence-before-spend.md`;
- `agent-docs/rules/optimization/one-variable.md`;
- `agent-docs/rules/verification/config-engagement.md`;
- `agent-docs/rules/verification/implausible-speedup.md`;
- `agent-docs/rules/verification/overlap.md`;
- `agent-docs/rules/verification/stack-verdict.md`;
- `agent-docs/guides/knob-tuning/tuning-hierarchy.md`;
- all three files under `agent-docs/guides/model-sizing/`;
- `agent-docs/guides/knob-tuning/dynamo.md`; and
- only the active engine guide: `agent-docs/guides/knob-tuning/vllm.md`,
  `agent-docs/guides/knob-tuning/sglang.md`, or `agent-docs/guides/knob-tuning/tensorrt-llm.md`.

Additionally read:

- `agent-docs/guides/rate-matching/matching.md` for a disaggregated allocation decision;
- `agent-docs/rules/benchmarking/concurrency-grid.md` when interpreting a capacity or concurrency series;
- `agent-docs/rules/benchmarking/proxy-workload-selection.md` when the audit identifies a recipe proxy;
- `agent-docs/rules/benchmarking/benchmark-isolation.md` when the audit reports an isolation limitation; and
- `agent-docs/references/reference-repos.md` before consulting current framework or Kubernetes source or official
  documentation.

Do not load guides for inactive engines. Verify version-sensitive flags and defaults against the active image, checked
out source, generated help, or official documentation. Treat evidence transferred across a model, engine version,
hardware class, topology, or workload as an explicit assumption.

## Validate The Decision Inputs

Proceed with a proposal only when:

- the smoke test succeeded;
- the benchmark audit status is `valid` or `valid_with_recovery`;
- the plan, audit, summary, and analysis identify the same active benchmark series;
- the summary and performance analysis refer to the current candidate and executed workload;
- the exact successful source manifest exists;
- target-fixed model, framework, precision, hardware, workload, and SLO constraints are known; and
- every direct comparison used as decision evidence is valid and same-series.

Record resource or placement differences as limitations. A valid absolute characterization may support a proposal
without a prior reference, but it cannot establish a gain or loss. If an input or claimed comparison is missing,
inconsistent, invalid, or non-comparable, write a `blocked` consultation. If the inputs are valid but no defensible
lever meets the evidence gate, write `no-proposal`.

## Establish The Performance Finding

Record:

- the primary objective or failed SLO and target operating region;
- absolute current metrics and client-visible symptoms;
- comparisons with the series baseline, previous valid iteration, best prior result per objective, and relevant
  same-series history when available;
- run count, repeat rationale when applicable, the measured noise floor of the active benchmark series (per
  `comparison-uncertainty.md`), and AIPerf confidence intervals or coefficient of variation only when deliberate
  repetitions made them useful;
- proxy limitations, missing metrics, resource or placement differences, or other uncertainty; and
- whether any surprising prior result needs engagement or plausibility rechecking.

AIPerf establishes client-visible behavior, not a router, scheduler, transfer, or backend root cause. State internal
mechanisms as hypotheses unless separate engagement or runtime evidence supports them.

## Enforce The Evidence Gate

A proposed candidate must cite at least three distinct evidence categories, and one must be AIPerf profiler data:

1. AIPerf profiler data and audited analysis tied to the objective or SLO.
2. Dynamo or active-engine source, official documentation, or performance guidance.
3. Same-series benchmark history from prior candidates.
4. Model architecture details relevant to the mechanism.
5. Hardware speed-of-light or roofline analysis when the mechanism concerns compute, memory, or communication limits.

Count categories, not citations. Multiple AIPerf metrics still count as one category. For each item, record the exact
path or citation, observation, what it supports, and its limitation. Do not invent category 5 when no applicable
analysis exists. If fewer than three categories qualify, use `no-proposal` and name the missing evidence.

## Calibrate Exploration Versus Exploitation

Before generating a hypothesis, determine whether a broad or narrow knob adjustment is needed.

- Prefer a broad move while any materially applicable, plausibly higher-upside lever family
  remains untested or has not been ruled out by current evidence.
- Prefer a narrow move only after the broad landscape has been screened and valid measurements
  show a demonstrated, meaningful signal in the selected family.
- Return to exploration when a narrow change is invalid, inconclusive, within the measured noise floor of the
  active benchmark series, reverses the expected direction, or reveals a different limiting regime.

Maintain one persistent search-calibration ledger for the engagement at
`EXP_ROOT/analysis/search-calibration.md` instead of regenerating a scan for every
hypothesis; each iteration's `knowledge-consult.md` records only the delta applied to it. The ledger is the
authoritative family table. When submitting a stop-request, record in `knowledge-consult.md` the ledger path and
the SHA256 of the ledger state being submitted, plus — whenever any granted budget is non-null — the derived
budget consumption (wall clock from `manifest.yaml`'s session start; failed deploys from the deployment ledgers' `failed_attempts` records; GPU-hours from GPU allocation time (per deployment ledger: `allocated_at` to `torn_down_at`, or to now if live, times its `gpus_requested`, summed across deployments)); do not modify the ledger while that validation is pending. Before each hypothesis, update the ledger by delta, re-reviewing every row whose evidence regime changed
(a topology adoption, new variance data, an answered ask). The ledger explicitly covers:

1. deployment topology and fit, including model fit, parallelism, replication, aggregated versus disaggregated
   serving, disaggregated rate matching, GPU allocation, and placement or fabric constraints;
2. every Category 2 family in `tuning-hierarchy.md`: CUDA graphs; admission, batching, prefill scheduling, and
   workspace; speculative decoding; KV-cache dtype and capacity; engine backend or autotuner selection; Dynamo
   routing and prefix reuse; KVBM or engine KV offload; and frontend, transport, and pod resources; and
3. Local Planner only when its conditional lane applies.

For each family, record its coverage as `tested`, `ruled-out`, `not-applicable`, `untested-promising`, `deferred`,
or `reopened-by-new-evidence`, plus its expected upside — recorded BOTH as a quantitative estimate and on the
ordinal scale with cutoffs DERIVED per engagement, recorded for readers of the ledger: `low` (below the
primary objective series' measured minimum detectable effect — indistinguishable from noise), `medium` (above
the MDE but below the engagement's practical-significance threshold), `high` (above that threshold). The
practical-significance threshold is the user's stated smallest-delta-that-matters when the interview captured
one; otherwise DEFAULT it to twice the measured MDE and say so. Record both derived cutoffs and their
derivation in the ledger header (`mde:`, `practical_significance:` lines above the family table) — and the
evidence for that disposition. A `deferred` row's cost-estimate-vs-remaining-budget numbers live in its
`Evidence and reason` cell. A `ruled-out` row must
cite a measurement, a sourced hard constraint, a confirmed incompatibility, or an explicit operator decision;
expected upside below the minimum detectable effect is `deferred` (still visible, and stackable under a documented
one-variable exception), never `ruled-out`. Compare all applicable families for potential benefit and information value before choosing one.

During exploration, prefer an independently testable change that crosses into a different high-impact family or tests
a coarse, documented operating regime. Do not keep adjusting the same knob in single-digit or otherwise near-neighbor
increments while a plausible higher-impact family remains untested. An immediate adjacent adjustment is appropriate only
when current evidence shows that family dominates the objective or a broad scan finds no plausible higher-upside alternative; record that exception.

## Select One Lever

Follow `agent-docs/guides/knob-tuning/tuning-hierarchy.md`:

1. Classify the exact model and compute memory fit, minimum parallelism, and headroom.
2. Complete the exploration-versus-exploitation calibration and full broad-lever scan above. As part of the broad
   scan, invoke `find-serving-recipe` once per engagement, reusing the latest snapshot listed in
   `EXP_ROOT/analysis/recipe-dossier/index.md` on later iterations when one exists, and record the snapshot's
   path and SHA256 in `knowledge-consult.md`, so that every
   recipe-shaped candidate under consideration carries a provenance verdict: a `deployable` or `hypothesis` grade
   candidate enters the lever shortlist with its dossier entry attached, and a `ceiling-only` candidate may inform
   expected-performance headroom but is never shortlisted for deployment. A recipe-sourced candidate goes through
   this same selection and the adversarial review like any other hypothesis; it never replaces the baseline.
3. Consider topology first as a hypothesis category per the tuning hierarchy; an inherited layout is a candidate,
   not a settled decision.
4. When topology is viable, consider Tier 2 families in default priority order, then finish screening the remaining
   families before selecting a candidate.
5. Record why each major family was retained, skipped, rejected, or superseded by stronger current-run evidence.
6. Consider Local Planner only when autoscaling is the explicit objective and the current single DGD already contains
   it.
7. Deduplicate the shortlist against all prior attempts and challenger reviews.
8. Rank surviving choices by direct evidence, expected effect on the primary objective, information value, risk,
   reversibility, experiment cost, and diff size.
9. Select a candidate consistent with the recorded search mode and explain why a broader move is not preferable when
   choosing narrow exploitation.

Select one independently testable knob. A coupled bundle is allowed only when every changed field is required for one
functional mechanism or prior isolated evidence supports the interaction. Classify the reason as
`functionality-required` or `evidence-supported-interaction`; list every field and any required follow-up ablation.

State the performance question and expected measurable effect for the candidate, but do not select benchmark settings
or require the current series to be reused. Do not weaken target-fixed constraints or retry an equivalent failed or
inconclusive candidate unless new evidence explains why its outcome may differ.

## Write The Consultation

Create:

```text
<EXP_ROOT>/artifacts/deploy-iter-<NNN>/next-candidate/knowledge-consult.md
```

Use `DEPLOY_ROOT/next-candidate/` as `HYPOTHESIS_ROOT`.
Write the file for `proposed`, `no-proposal`, and `blocked` outcomes. Do not create `deploy-draft.yaml`; that belongs to
`create-optimization-hypothesis`.

Use this as a loose outline, not a form. Keep the `Decision`, `Evidence`, `Proposed Change`, and
`Materialization Handoff` sections so the next skill can find the required facts. Organize the reasoning in whatever
way best explains the recommendation, add useful subsections, and omit irrelevant prompts.

```markdown
# Performance Knowledge Consultation: Candidate Iteration <NNN + 1>

## Decision
- Status: proposed | no-proposal | blocked
- Search mode: exploration | exploitation
- Search breadth: broad | narrow
- Calibration rationale:

## Search Calibration
Include one row for topology and fit and for every Category 2 lever family. Include Local Planner only when applicable.

| Major lever category or family | Coverage status | Evidence and reason | Expected upside | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Reasoning
Summarize the primary objective/SLO, the measured problem, relevant comparisons and uncertainty, applicable model or topology constraints, tuning guidance, prior attempts, and why this is the most useful next experiment. Include assumptions or missing evidence that affect confidence.

## Evidence
- Qualifying category count:

| Category | Evidence and source | Relevance and limitation |
|---|---|---|

## Proposed Change
- Candidate type: single-knob | coupled-bundle | none
- Knob owner: Dynamo | vLLM | SGLang | TensorRT-LLM | none
- Primary knob:
- Performance question:
- Target operating region:
- Expected measurable effect:
- Risks/metrics that may regress:
- Coupling reason: none | functionality-required | evidence-supported-interaction
- Required follow-up ablation (if necessary):

## Materialization Handoff
- Source manifest:
- Source manifest SHA256:
- Intended draft: next-candidate/deploy-draft.yaml
- Draft manifest SHA256: pending

```

Keep every evidence item used to support the decision, grouped under its qualifying category. Include at least three
distinct categories, including AIPerf profiler data, but keep each entry concise. Name any repository guide, source, or
official documentation that supplied a constraint or recommendation.

Include relevant same-series history and tuning-hierarchy decisions without reproducing every rejected option. Treat
cross-series results as context only. Classify an absolute change at or below the measured noise floor of the active
benchmark series (per `comparison-uncertainty.md`) as noise. A clear, substantial,
plausible improvement may be supported by one valid run; do not require a repeat or confidence intervals solely to
support it. Preserve an `inconclusive` analysis when the evidence cannot support the direction or magnitude. Always
include the search calibration, even for `no-proposal` or `blocked`, so the next iteration does not forget unexplored
families or resume narrow tuning by default.

## Return

For `proposed`, return `knowledge-consult.md` to `create-optimization-hypothesis`. For `no-proposal` or `blocked`, return
the consultation to the caller and stop without creating a draft.
