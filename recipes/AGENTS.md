- Recipe-local Kustomize sources live in `<deployment>/kustomize/`: `base/` is
  shared input and never renders directly; `components/` holds building blocks
  used only by that recipe; public overlays under `overlays/<name>/` render to
  `deploy-<name>.yaml`; an `overlays/generic/` variant renders when it exists.
  Shared Components selected by multiple recipes live under
  `recipes/kustomize/components/`; that directory has no base or overlays and
  never renders by itself. The copy-and-fill beta cluster scaffold lives under
  `recipes/templates/kustomize/`; its structural Components use guarded JSON
  6902 patches against canonical `nvidia.com/v1beta1` component positions, its
  networking Components and hook patches use strategic merge patches addressed
  by component name, it requires standalone Kustomize v5.8.1, and its root
  Kustomization selects a generated copy of the OpenAPI Component under
  `components/dynamo-openapi/` first. Keep
  filled site values outside the repository. Portable templates omit
  credential Secret references and probe structs. They use the canonical
  `shared-model-cache` bundle, exec-form runtime commands, and
  `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`. Every beta component sets both offline
  environment variables; beta Frontends do not mount the cache, and beta
  backend workers run as UID/GID 0 with `IPC_LOCK`, `SYS_PTRACE`, and
  `SYS_RESOURCE`. The scaffold's optional `probes` Component owns complete
  worker startup-probe overrides. Place it after registry credentials and
  before scheduling. In the legacy alpha matrix path, prefer
  resource-shaped Kustomize merge patches where possible. Legacy bases
  that use strategic merge against Dynamo CRDs include the central
  `recipes/kustomize/components/dynamo-openapi/` Component; its schema is
  generated from every operator CRD. The central
  `recipes/kustomize/components/disagg-workers/` Components require one DGD per
  base with backend-neutral `PrefillWorker` and `DecodeWorker` service keys.
  A recipe matrix at `.kustomize-matrix.yaml` has an explicit `source`, a
  `nameTemplate`, and a `matrix` mapping whose values contain a `name` and may
  provide `components`, `templates`, `values`, and `sortOptions`. The matrix,
  recipe-local base and Components, and shared Components are source.
  `sortOptions` orders the resources in that value's generated overlay. Each
  template selection has a source relative to the matrix and a generated `path`
  under the overlay's `components/` directory. Generated paths
  selected by one variant must be unique and non-overlapping. Shared
  template sources live in `recipes/kustomize/templates/`. A selected template
  directory extends the direct `*.yaml` and `*.yaml.j2` files in its parent
  directory by convention. Only direct files participate; never scan or copy
  subdirectories.
  Parent files are loaded first, then same-output-name files in the selected
  directory replace them (`patch.yaml` and `patch.yaml.j2` both produce
  `patch.yaml`, so either form replaces the other). Optional `values.yaml`
  mappings use shallow parent-to-selected replacement before matrix values. The
  effective files must provide a `kustomization.yaml` or
  `kustomization.yaml.j2` that renders a Component.
  `unfold` evaluates the template with strict sandboxed Jinja, the variant values,
  and the fully rendered base indexed as `base.<lowercase-kind>[metadata.name]`.
  Use `base.<lowercase-kind> | only` only when exactly one such resource is
  required. Templates render one Component. `unfold` materializes the complete
  effective files at its selected path under the generated overlay. Files ending
  in `*.j2` are rendered without that suffix. A template may reference shared
  Components or resources; `unfold` rebases those external paths for the
  generated location.
  Kustomize is both the authoring model and recipe documentation: the base and
  Components explain settings, public overlay `kustomization.yaml` files
  document a concrete variant, and `deploy-*.yaml` files are the fully
  materialized result. Users may apply a checked-in manifest
  with `kubectl apply -f`, a checked-in public overlay with `kubectl apply -k`,
  or an overlay they compose themselves. Contributors run all matrix commands
  from the repository root. `scripts/kustomize-matrix.py unfold <matrix.yaml>`
  writes every generated public overlay and selected generated Component for that
  matrix; follow it with
  `scripts/kustomize-matrix.py render <matrix.yaml>` to regenerate every
  checked-in manifest for that matrix and the central schema. To inspect only
  one concrete overlay, run `kustomize build <deployment>/kustomize/overlays/<name>`.
  Do not hand-edit generated artifacts. `scripts/kustomize-matrix.py check`
  validates every matrix and detects artifacts left by moved matrices; use
  `unfold --clean` and `render --clean` to remove those explicitly. To compose
  additional Components without a checked-in overlay, use
  `scripts/kustomize-matrix.py compose <target> [<component-path>...] [<build-options>...]`.
  The target must be first, Components follow it, and Kustomize build options
  come last.
