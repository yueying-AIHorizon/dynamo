# Request Trace Utilities

Utilities for working with Dynamo `dynamo.request.trace.v1` files emitted by
`DYN_REQUEST_TRACE_SINKS=jsonl` or `jsonl_gz`.

## Convert to Perfetto

```bash
python3 benchmarks/request_trace/convert_to_perfetto.py \
  "/tmp/dynamo-request-trace.*.jsonl.gz" \
  --output /tmp/dynamo-request-trace.perfetto.json
```

Open the output JSON in [Perfetto UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).

Inputs may be `.jsonl`, `.jsonl.gz`, a directory containing trace shards, or a
glob pattern. The converter emits Chrome Trace Event JSON:

- one request trace per Perfetto process
- one session lane per Perfetto thread
- one LLM request slice per Dynamo `request_end`
- prefill wait, prefill, and decode stage slices stacked under the request by
  default
- one tool slice per harness `tool_end`/`tool_error`; explicit
  `started_at_unix_ms`/`ended_at_unix_ms` are preferred, then `duration_ms`,
  then paired `tool_start` timing when both records are present
- inferred tool slices from request `finish_reason_metadata.tool_calls` when
  no matching tool event was traced; when the next request in the same session
  starts after the tool-call response, the slice spans that gap, otherwise the
  converter emits a short `duration_unknown` synthetic slice at the response
  end, including when there is no following request in the same session
- finish metadata on request slices, including final finish reason, backend
  finish reason, stop reason, per-choice finish summaries, and complete
  tool-call names
- optional first-token markers with `--include-markers`

Use `--no-stages` for a compact request-only view.

Stage slice boundaries are normalized to avoid same-thread overlap caused by
independent metric rounding. Raw timing fields remain available in event args.

## Replay Dynamo Request Traces

Traces captured with Dynamo request tracing include replay hashes whenever a
request can be replayed by Dynamo mock workers. Save `/tmp/request-trace-prediction.yaml` with the
original JSONL or JSONL.GZ shards:

```yaml
traffic:
  source:
    type: trace
    format: dynamo
    paths: [/tmp/dynamo-request-trace.0000.jsonl.gz]
  load: {type: trace_timestamps, speedup: 1.0}
engine:
  mode: aggregated
  model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  hardware: h200_sxm
  backend: vllm
  context_length: max
  workers:
    aggregated:
      parallelism: {replicas: 4, tensor: 1, pipeline: 1, attention_data: 1, moe_tensor: 1, moe_expert: 1}
      scheduler: {max_batched_tokens: 8192, max_sequences: 256}
      kv_cache: {block_size: 64, prefix_caching: true, capacity: {type: default, memory_fraction: 0.9}}
      timing: {type: default}
router:
  policy: kv_router
  prefill_load_model: {type: none}
planner: {policy: disabled}
```

Add every shard to `traffic.source.paths`, then run the offline prediction:

```bash
aisimulate predict \
  --stack dynamo \
  --config /tmp/request-trace-prediction.yaml \
  --output-dir /tmp/request-trace-prediction
```

No format conversion or intermediate Mooncake file is required.

AISimulate derives the trace block size from the request records and rejects mixed
block sizes across shards. Context-free traces use standard replay. Traces in
which every request has `agent_context` use agentic replay. Mixed traces are
rejected.

`router.policy: kv_router` requires more than one mock worker. For a single aggregated-worker
sanity check, set `router.policy: round_robin` and
`engine.workers.aggregated.parallelism.replicas: 1`.

## Validate Converter

The converter has a local self-check that is intentionally not wired into the
main pytest suite:

```bash
python3 benchmarks/request_trace/validate_convert_to_perfetto.py
```
