"""Concurrency micro-bench: does AIC `predict` serialize under threads?

Measures predict throughput (calls/s) as the number of concurrent threads grows,
for three latency-prediction variants — isolating the GIL behaviour that decides
whether the Rust migration helps under concurrency (e.g. live serving with many
worker threads), which the offline-replay e2e bench does not exercise.

Variants
--------
- `engine_pyo3`  — `AicEngine.predict_decode_latency` (the compiled Rust engine).
  Its `#[pymethods]` wrap the compute in `py.allow_threads(...)`, so the GIL is
  RELEASED during the Rust compute. This is the closest Python-measurable proxy
  for the pure-Rust `RustAicCallback` hot path (the Rust callback additionally
  avoids the per-call GIL acquire for arg marshalling — the ~7% e2e edge).
- `compiled_shell` — `AicSession.predict_decode` over the compiled engine
  (Python wrapper bytecode + pyo3). What `PyAicCallback` calls today.
- `opwalk` — `AicSession.predict_decode` with the compiled engine DISABLED
  (`DYNAMO_AIC_DISABLE_COMPILED_ENGINE=1`): the pre-#1200 pure-Python op-walk,
  which holds the GIL through the whole compute.

A variant whose throughput scales with thread count is concurrency-friendly; one
that stays flat is GIL-serialized. The scaling gap between `opwalk` and the
engine variants is the concurrency benefit the Rust core (#1200) unlocked; the
pure-Rust callback preserves it and removes the residual marshalling cost.
