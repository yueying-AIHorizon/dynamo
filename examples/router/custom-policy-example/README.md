# Custom Worker Selection Policies

Use this example as the build guide for a custom Rust worker-selection policy. It covers the full path from `WorkerFilter`, `WorkerScorer`, and `WorkerPicker` implementations to a linked Python frontend or standalone Endpoint Picker Provider (EPP).

## What You Are Building

```text
policy crate -> catalog crate -> router-policy YAML -> frontend or EPP binary
```

- The policy crate owns the filtering, scoring, and picking algorithm.
- The catalog gives each policy type a stable name.
- The YAML file creates named policy instances and supplies parameters.
- The frontend or EPP links the catalog at compile time.

Dynamo owns discovery, eligibility, queueing, validation, reservations, accounting, and metrics. A policy sees only eligible workers and returns one candidate row.

Preferred routing taints are optional candidate metadata. A filter, scorer, or picker must request `WorkerInputs::PREFERRED_TAINT` before reading `preferred_taint_multiplier()` from a candidate; otherwise, Dynamo does not materialize the multiplier. Exact hard-pinned requests also do not materialize it. Required routing taints remain Dynamo eligibility rules.

## Pick a Starting Point

| Crate | Use it for |
|---|---|
| [`soft-pin-repin`](soft-pin-repin/README.md) | Retain a soft session-affinity target until its active-request load exceeds a threshold, then repin |
| `simple-filter-score-pick` | One filter, one scorer, and one picker show the complete policy flow |
| `disagg-filter-score-pick` | Prefill and decode workers each need the complete policy flow |
| `simple-stacked-score-pick` | Multiple scorer costs compose before one picker runs |

The `simple-filter-score-pick` policy shows the complete pipeline. It filters on minimum device overlap and scores active requests. Its picker normally selects the lowest cost. Tool-result turns select the worker with the most device overlap through `session_context().input_trigger()`.

The [`soft-pin-repin` policy](soft-pin-repin/README.md) documents its load threshold, soft-binding behavior, and two-Mocker `A -> B -> B` walkthrough.

The `disagg-filter-score-pick` policy applies the overlap filter to both worker types. Its factory matches the routing stage and calls separate prefill and decode policy builders. Each builder shows the complete filter, scorer, and picker composition for that stage.

The embedded frontend supplies `WorkerType::Prefill` or `WorkerType::Decode` after discovery scopes the worker pool. This disaggregated policy rejects the standalone EPP's `WorkerType::Aggregated` pool because it cannot apply separate prefill and decode behavior. Other unsupported roles also stop instead of silently using the prefill policy.

The `simple-stacked-score-pick` policy has no custom filter. It adds active-request and uncached-request costs before its picker selects the lowest total.

## 1. Create the Policy Crate

Create a Rust library crate outside the Dynamo checkout:

```bash
# Create the policy crate.
cargo new --lib my-worker-policy
cd my-worker-policy

# Use the router crate from the same Dynamo checkout as the host process.
cargo add dynamo-kv-router \
  --path /work/dynamo/lib/kv-router \
  --features standalone-selection

# Add YAML parameter deserialization.
cargo add serde --features derive
```

A policy that lives in the Dynamo workspace can use the workspace dependencies shown in [`simple-filter-score-pick/Cargo.toml`](simple-filter-score-pick/Cargo.toml).

## 2. Implement the Filter, Scorers, and Picker

Each policy stage has one job:

| Stage | Role |
|---|---|
| Filter (`filter.rs`) | Removes workers that do not meet a hard requirement |
| Scorer (`scorer.rs`) | Assigns a finite, lower-is-better cost to each remaining worker. Dynamo adds costs from stacked scorers |
| Picker (`picker.rs`) | Selects one row from the scored candidates |

Each example keeps its implemented stages in these matching files. `lib.rs` parses parameters, composes the stages, and registers the policy. The stacked example keeps each scorer implementation in a separate file under [`scorer/`](simple-stacked-score-pick/src/scorer/).

Read the [custom worker-selection guide](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/docs/fern/pages/developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/router/custom-worker-selection.mdx) for input groups, method contracts, and error handling.

## 3. Parse Parameters and Build the Factory

The registry calls the provider once at startup for the selected policy instance. The provider parses and validates the YAML parameters. It then returns a factory that captures the validated values:

```rust
#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]
struct Parameters {
    min_device_overlap_blocks: f64,
}

fn provider(
    parameters: &WorkerSelectionPolicyParameters,
) -> Result<WorkerSelectionPolicyFactory, WorkerSelectionPolicyProviderError> {
    let parameters: Parameters = parameters.deserialize()?;
    if !parameters.min_device_overlap_blocks.is_finite()
        || parameters.min_device_overlap_blocks < 0.0
    {
        return Err(WorkerSelectionPolicyProviderError::new(
            "min_device_overlap_blocks must be a finite non-negative number",
        ));
    }
    let min_device_overlap_blocks = parameters.min_device_overlap_blocks;

    Ok(Arc::new(move |config, worker_type, _partition| {
        let filters: Vec<Box<dyn WorkerFilter>> = vec![
            Box::new(MinimumDeviceOverlapFilter {
                min_device_overlap_blocks,
            }),
        ];

        WorkerSelectionPolicy::new_with_filters(
            config.clone(),
            worker_type.as_str(),
            filters,
            vec![Box::new(ActiveRequestsScorer)],
            Box::new(RequestAwarePicker),
        )
    }))
}
```

`worker_type` is a typed `WorkerType`. `WorkerSelectionPolicy` accepts a static worker label for its routing logs, so `as_str()` converts only at the constructor boundary. Match on the enum before this conversion when each role needs different behavior.

The provider and factory have different lifetimes:

1. The registry matches the YAML `type` to a provider.
2. The provider parses one named instance and returns one shared factory.
3. Dynamo calls the factory once for each model and routing-group partition.
4. Each factory call creates a new filter, scorer, and picker set for that partition.

The factory also receives the typed `WorkerType` role. Hosts pass `Aggregated`, `Prefill`, or `Decode` when they construct that worker pool. Use the partition value when models or routing groups need separate policy state.

## 4. Register the Policy Type

Expose one registration function from the policy crate:

```rust
pub fn register(
    registry: &mut WorkerSelectionPolicyRegistry,
) -> Result<(), WorkerSelectionPolicyRegistryError> {
    registry.register("simple-filter-score-pick", Arc::new(provider))
}
```

Choose a stable, unique type name. The name becomes part of the YAML contract.

Add the policy dependency and registration call to the catalog that ships with the host process. See [`catalog/src/lib.rs`](catalog/src/lib.rs).

## 5. Configure a Policy Instance

Create a YAML file outside the source tree:

```yaml
worker_selection:
  aggregated: simple-filter-score-pick
  prefill: disagg-prefill
  decode: disagg-decode
  encode: simple-filter-score-pick
  instances:
    - name: simple-filter-score-pick
      type: simple-filter-score-pick
      parameters:
        min_device_overlap_blocks: 0
    - name: filter-score-pick-cache-affinity
      type: simple-filter-score-pick
      parameters:
        min_device_overlap_blocks: 8
    - name: disagg-prefill
      type: disagg-filter-score-pick
      parameters:
        min_device_overlap_blocks: 0
    - name: disagg-decode
      type: disagg-filter-score-pick
      parameters:
        min_device_overlap_blocks: 0
    - name: simple-stacked-score-pick
      type: simple-stacked-score-pick
      parameters: {}
    - name: soft-pin-repin
      type: soft-pin-repin
      parameters:
        max_active_requests: 0
```

- `type` selects a registered provider.
- `name` identifies one configured instance.
- `worker_selection.aggregated`, `worker_selection.prefill`, `worker_selection.decode`, and `worker_selection.encode` select separate instances for their matching worker pools.
- `worker_selection.encode` applies only to surface-carrying encode worker sets that construct the standard KV chooser. The surface-less multimodal encoder hop uses `EncoderRouter` and round-robin selection instead.
- `--router-prefill-policy` and `--router-decode-policy` override the matching YAML selections.
- `DYN_ROUTER_PREFILL_POLICY` and `DYN_ROUTER_DECODE_POLICY` provide stage-specific environment overrides.
- `DYN_ROUTER_WORKER_SELECTION_POLICY` overrides every worker-type YAML selection.
- The override value `default` selects Dynamo's built-in policy.

Unknown policy types, duplicate registrations, and invalid parameters stop startup.

The `min_device_overlap_blocks` parameter is a hard filter. A value of `0` keeps cold workers for a smoke test. If every worker is below a positive threshold, Dynamo returns HTTP 503.

## 6. Build and Test

Run these commands from the Dynamo repository root:

```bash
cargo test \
  -p dynamo-custom-policy-example-soft-pin-repin \
  -p dynamo-custom-policy-example-simple-filter-score-pick \
  -p dynamo-custom-policy-example-disagg-filter-score-pick \
  -p dynamo-custom-policy-example-simple-stacked-score-pick \
  -p dynamo-custom-policy-example-catalog
cargo build -p dynamo-custom-policy-example-epp
```

Add one focused test for the policy decision and one registration test for each new type. If a new input adds calculation, allocation, storage, or scans, add a worker-selection benchmark.

## Run With the Python Frontend

The Python extension uses the dependency alias `dynamo-worker-selection-policy-catalog`. Point that alias at the catalog in the checkout that you build:

```bash
export DYNAMO_DIR="$(pwd)"

cargo add \
  --manifest-path "$DYNAMO_DIR/lib/bindings/python/Cargo.toml" \
  --optional \
  --rename dynamo-worker-selection-policy-catalog \
  --path "$DYNAMO_DIR/examples/router/custom-policy-example/catalog" \
  dynamo-custom-policy-example-catalog
```

Build the extension with the linked catalog:

```bash
cd "$DYNAMO_DIR/lib/bindings/python"
CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$DYNAMO_DIR/target" maturin develop --uv --features custom-policy

cd "$DYNAMO_DIR"
uv pip install -e .
python3 -m dynamo.frontend \
  --router-mode kv \
  --router-policy-config /path/to/worker-selection.yaml
```

For a private catalog, keep the dependency alias and change the package name and path. Linked policies apply to the embedded frontend selection service and to `python3 -m dynamo.router`. The standalone Python router waits for a worker model card so it can dispatch built-in or linked policy behavior by the typed role. `DYN_ROUTER_MODEL_CARD_WAIT_SECS` bounds this wait and defaults to 600 seconds.

## Run With EPP

The example EPP links the example catalog and registers it before the standard runner starts:

```rust
let mut registry = WorkerSelectionPolicyRegistry::default();
dynamo_custom_policy_example_catalog::register(&mut registry)?;
run(Some(registry)).await
```

Run the binary in standalone mode:

```bash
DYN_EPP_MODE=standalone \
DYN_ROUTER_POLICY_CONFIG=/path/to/worker-selection.yaml \
DYN_ROUTER_WORKER_SELECTION_POLICY=simple-filter-score-pick \
  cargo run --release -p dynamo-custom-policy-example-epp
```

Standalone EPP supplies `WorkerType::Aggregated` because it selects from one full-request worker pool. `disagg-filter-score-pick` intentionally rejects that role and is only usable with disaggregated frontend pools. The Rust EPP's Dynamo-runtime mode has native prefill/decode routing, but linked custom policy catalogs are not supported in that mode.

Follow the [standalone EPP guide](../../../docs/fern/pages/kubernetes/kv-aware-routing/vanilla-vllm-onramp.mdx) for discovery, KV events, tokenization, and Kubernetes resources.

## Before You Ship

- Build the policy against the same Dynamo revision as the frontend or EPP.
- Make sure that each component declares every input group that it reads.
- Check every parameter before the factory is created.
- Exercise each `worker_type` branch.
- Prove that filter failures, all-filtered candidate sets, scorer failures, and invalid picker rows do not reserve a worker.
- Benchmark stateful or input-heavy policies at the expected worker count.

The [custom routing API reference](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/docs/fern/pages/developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/router/custom-worker-selection.mdx) lists the available context and worker signals.

## Try the Policies End to End With Mocker

Use the embedded Python frontend for this local test. The standalone EPP uses Kubernetes `InferencePool` discovery. Complete [Run With the Python Frontend](#run-with-the-python-frontend) first so that the extension links this example catalog.

Create `/tmp/worker-selection.yaml` with the policy instances from [Configure a Policy Instance](#5-configure-a-policy-instance).

Use `min_device_overlap_blocks: 0` for this test. A positive threshold can reject every worker on a cold request or a replay path without raw tier data.

For overload-aware soft affinity, follow the [`soft-pin-repin` two-Mocker walkthrough](soft-pin-repin/README.md#run-with-two-mockers).

### Aggregated Policy

In the first terminal, start the frontend with the `simple-filter-score-pick` policy:

```bash
DYN_ROUTER_WORKER_SELECTION_POLICY=simple-filter-score-pick \
python -m dynamo.frontend \
  --router-mode kv \
  --router-policy-config /tmp/worker-selection.yaml \
  --discovery-backend file \
  --http-port 8000
```

In the second terminal, start two aggregated Mocker workers:

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.mocker \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --discovery-backend file \
  --num-workers 2
```

In the third terminal, send a request:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "max_tokens": 32
  }'
```

A response confirms that the linked provider created the policy and selected a Mocker worker. The frontend log records the selected worker and its policy cost as `logit`.

Keep the Mocker process active to try `simple-stacked-score-pick`. Stop the frontend and restart it with:

```bash
DYN_ROUTER_WORKER_SELECTION_POLICY=simple-stacked-score-pick \
python -m dynamo.frontend \
  --router-mode kv \
  --router-policy-config /tmp/worker-selection.yaml \
  --discovery-backend file \
  --http-port 8000
```

Send the same request. This time, `logit` is the sum of the active-request and uncached-request costs.

### Disaggregated Policy

Stop the frontend and Mocker processes. Start the frontend with separate named prefill and decode policy instances:

```bash
python -m dynamo.frontend \
  --router-mode kv \
  --router-policy-config /tmp/worker-selection.yaml \
  --router-prefill-policy disagg-prefill \
  --router-decode-policy disagg-decode \
  --discovery-backend file \
  --http-port 8000
```

The two flags override `worker_selection.prefill` and `worker_selection.decode`. Omit the flags to use the YAML selections.

In the second terminal, start two prefill Mocker workers:

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.mocker \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --discovery-backend file \
  --disaggregation-mode prefill \
  --bootstrap-ports 50100,50101 \
  --num-workers 2
```

`--bootstrap-ports` takes a comma-separated port for each prefill worker.

In the third terminal, start two decode Mocker workers:

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.mocker \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --discovery-backend file \
  --disaggregation-mode decode \
  --num-workers 2
```

Send the same `curl` request from a fourth terminal. The frontend log records separate prefill and decode selections. Each worker set runs its own filter, scorer, and picker.
