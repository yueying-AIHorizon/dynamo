title: Secure Deployment Guidelines
subtitle: Trust model and hardening guidance for production Dynamo deployments
---

NVIDIA Dynamo is a high-performance distributed inference platform designed to be
deployed within a secure, trusted environment. A deployment coordinates many
parts — a frontend, backend workers, a KV router, and internal communication
planes for discovery, events, and requests — across a cluster. This guide
describes Dynamo's trust model and how to secure each part of a deployment.

Dynamo is designed to be deployed within a trusted network boundary: external
clients reach only the frontend, through an authenticating gateway, and the
internal communication planes and infrastructure run on a network isolated from
untrusted access. The sections below explain that boundary and provide details on
how to further harden different aspects, including further hardening of the
internal communication planes. Users deploying Dynamo should make their own
decision in balancing functionality, performance, and security within the trusted
network boundary.

Throughout this guide, **deployer** refers to the team responsible for deploying
and operating Dynamo in a cluster — distinct from the **Dynamo Operator**, the
Kubernetes operator component.

## Trust Model

Dynamo separates client-facing traffic from internal coordination:

- The **external-facing inference API** — the frontend's OpenAI-compatible HTTP
  endpoint, which serves inference requests to clients.
- The **internal communication planes** — discovery, event, and request planes,
  plus infrastructure services (NATS, ModelExpress, and the NIXL/RDMA
  data-transfer fabric) that components use to find each other and coordinate.

The security posture rests on two assumptions:

1. The **internal communication planes and infrastructure services** are deployed by the
   deployer in a secure fashion and reside within a **trusted network** that
   external clients cannot reach.
2. **External clients reach only the frontend**, and only through a gateway or
   proxy that terminates authentication and TLS.

If both hold, the externally reachable surface is limited to the frontend's
inference API. The sections below explain how to satisfy each assumption.

![Dynamo trust boundary — external clients reach the frontends only through an authenticating gateway; the internal communication planes and backend workers run on the trusted network and must be isolated from outside the cluster.](../../../assets/img/secure-deployment-trust-boundary.svg)

The gateway is the only entry point into the cluster for external clients; it forwards to the
frontends (the external-facing inference API). Everything inside — the frontends,
the internal communication planes, and the workers — runs on the trusted network
and must be protected from access outside the cluster.

## Securing the External-Facing Inference API

Do not expose the Dynamo frontend directly to an untrusted network. Deploy it as
a microservice behind a dedicated gateway or proxy that provides:

- **Authentication and authorization** of clients.
- **TLS termination** and encryption in transit.
- **Rate limiting** and request-size limits.
- **Load balancing** across frontend replicas.

On Kubernetes, place a standard ingress or Gateway that you configure for
authentication and TLS in front of the Dynamo Frontend service. End-user
authentication and authorization remain the gateway's responsibility. If you
adopt Dynamo's optional [Gateway API routing topology](../../kubernetes/installation/gateway-api-routing.mdx),
note that its Endpoint Picker selects a backend for load and KV-cache reasons and
does not authenticate clients, so it still sits behind your authenticating
gateway.

TLS termination at the gateway secures only the client-to-gateway hop. If traffic
from the gateway to the frontend crosses an untrusted segment, re-encrypt that hop
by enabling the frontend's own server-side TLS (`DYN_TLS_CERT_PATH` /
`DYN_TLS_KEY_PATH`). To also require a client certificate from the gateway, set
`DYN_TLS_CLIENT_CA_CERT_PATH` on the frontend and configure the gateway to present
a certificate signed by a trusted CA. In this topology, mutual TLS (mTLS)
authenticates the gateway on the gateway-to-frontend connection. End-user
authentication and authorization remain the gateway's responsibility. See
[HTTP TLS and mTLS](../../reference/components/tls-configuration.mdx#http-tls-and-mtls).

## Securing the Internal Communication Planes

Dynamo components coordinate over three internal communication planes —
**discovery**, **event**, and **request**. All three are intended to run within
the trusted network and must never be reachable by untrusted clients. Secure each
as follows.

### Discovery plane

Workers register their endpoints and are discovered through the discovery plane.

- **Recommended — Kubernetes-based discovery.** Set
  `DYN_DISCOVERY_BACKEND=kubernetes`. Dynamo discovers workers through RBAC-gated
  custom resources; reads and writes are authorized by the Kubernetes API server
  using each pod's ServiceAccount, so there is no anonymous, network-reachable
  discovery store to protect.
- **etcd (legacy — local, bare-metal, or non-Kubernetes only).** etcd discovery is
  **deprecated for Kubernetes**; the Dynamo Operator uses Kubernetes-native
  discovery by default, and a Kubernetes deployment should not add a second
  network-reachable discovery store. Where you do use etcd, enable authentication —
  never anonymous access on a shared network. Dynamo's etcd client supports
  username/password (`ETCD_AUTH_USERNAME`/`ETCD_AUTH_PASSWORD`) and mutual TLS
  (`ETCD_AUTH_CA`, `ETCD_AUTH_CLIENT_CERT`, `ETCD_AUTH_CLIENT_KEY`).

**Why it matters:** an unauthenticated discovery plane lets any peer on the
network enumerate workers and inject or alter routing metadata. See the
[Discovery Plane](../knowledge-base/concepts/system-architecture/architecture.md#discovery-plane)
reference.

### Event plane

Components exchange coordination events — including the KV-cache events used for
KV-aware routing — over the event plane. Dynamo supports two event transports,
selected by `DYN_EVENT_PLANE`:

- **NATS** supports authentication — `NATS_AUTH_USERNAME`/`NATS_AUTH_PASSWORD`, or
  `NATS_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NATS_AUTH_NKEY`, or `NATS_AUTH_CREDENTIALS_FILE` — and TLS
  (`NATS_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH`). Whether the NATS server *requires* these is enforced
  by the NATS server configuration (for example `tls { ca_file: …; verify: true }`),
  not by Dynamo, so harden the server config as well.
- **ZMQ** is the default event transport in configurations without NATS, and some
  backends (for example, vLLM) publish KV-cache events over ZMQ natively. Dynamo's
  ZMQ transports do not add authentication or encryption. Treat all KV-cache events
  as sensitive request-derived data. Raw engine-side stored-block events can contain
  token IDs and cache/LoRA context; the token IDs can expose block-aligned request
  text when decoded with the corresponding tokenizer. Dynamo's normalized
  event-plane payloads instead carry deterministic per-token-block hashes, which can
  reveal equality or shared-prefix relationships and support offline dictionary
  attacks against predictable token blocks. Neither representation necessarily
  exposes the complete prompt. Keep every ZMQ endpoint on the trusted network: bind
  the broker (`ZMQ_BROKER_XSUB_BIND` / `ZMQ_BROKER_XPUB_BIND`) and the advertised
  KV-event host to cluster-internal addresses, keep intra-node sockets on loopback,
  and restrict who can publish or subscribe with NetworkPolicy.

**Why it matters:** the event plane carries **sensitive request-derived data** —
KV events can disclose or help infer prompt content, depending on the publisher and
wire representation — so keep it on the trusted network and restrict publishers and
subscribers. See the
[Event Plane](../knowledge-base/concepts/system-architecture/architecture.md#event-plane)
reference.

### Request plane

Requests and KV-cache data move between components over the request plane. The
transport is selected by `DYN_REQUEST_PLANE` — `tcp` (with the NIXL/RDMA fabric
for data transfer) or `nats` — and the TLS/mTLS settings below apply to whichever
you use.

- **Encrypt the request plane with TLS.** For the TCP transport, enable TLS with
  `DYN_TCP_TLS_CERT_PATH` + `DYN_TCP_TLS_KEY_PATH` (server side); clients verify the
  server with `DYN_TCP_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH` (and `DYN_TCP_TLS_SERVER_NAME` to pin the
  expected name). For the NATS transport, enable TLS with `NATS_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH`.
  This protects the confidentiality and integrity of request-plane traffic in
  transit.
- **Authenticate both ends with mutual TLS (mTLS).** Set
  `DYN_TCP_TLS_CLIENT_CA_CERT_PATH` on the server so it requires clients to present
  a certificate — an unauthenticated client is then rejected at the handshake;
  clients present an identity with `DYN_TCP_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH` /
  `DYN_TCP_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`. For the NATS transport, use
  `NATS_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH` / `NATS_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`.
- **Constrain the trust domain.** TLS clients must validate the server certificate
  against an appropriately constrained trust root and the expected server identity.
  mTLS servers must likewise require client certificates from a trust domain scoped
  to the intended callers. Certificate authentication does not replace authorization
  or network isolation.
- Keep the **NIXL/RDMA** data-transfer fabric on the trusted network.

**Why it matters:** TLS encrypts request-plane traffic, and mTLS additionally
authenticates the client so an unauthenticated peer cannot deliver requests or
data-transfer payloads to a worker. Keep the plane on the trusted network as
defense in depth. See
[request-plane TLS and mTLS](../../reference/components/tls-configuration.mdx).

## Restrict or Disable Optional Surfaces

Dynamo exposes optional control and extension surfaces beyond plain inference.
Disable the ones you do not need so that only the required capabilities are
reachable.

### Frontend extensions and admin API

- **Client-controlled routing (`nvext`).** By default the frontend honors an
  `nvext` request extension and routing-override headers that let a client pin a
  request to a specific worker instance. In a multi-tenant or untrusted-client
  setting, the deployer may want to set `DYN_DISABLE_FRONTEND_NVEXT=1` so clients cannot
  target individual
  workers. This drops `request.nvext` at handler entry and ignores the
  routing-override headers.
- **Admin API.** The frontend's HTTP admin API (for example,
  `GET`/`POST /busy_threshold`) is enabled by default. If the deployer does not need to
  change runtime tunables through it, set `DYN_DISABLE_FRONTEND_ADMIN_API=1`.
  Inference, metrics, models, health, and liveness routes are unaffected.
- **Metrics endpoint.** The `/metrics` endpoint is intended for scraping by
  trusted monitoring systems; scope it to your observability stack rather than
  exposing it to untrusted networks.

### Internal control and diagnostic interfaces

Dynamo's internal control and diagnostic interfaces — for example the worker
system server (`/engine/*` on `DYN_SYSTEM_PORT`), the planner live dashboard and
plugin registration, and the standalone KV router services (indexer, selection,
and slot tracker) — are designed to be used within the trusted network boundary.
While some provide their own authentication, many do not, and several bind on all
interfaces.

**Keep every such interface on the trusted network**, expose only the routes a
deployment uses, and disable the ones you don't need. In operator-managed
deployments, the Dynamo Operator enables the worker system server on
`DYN_SYSTEM_PORT=9090` and exposes it through an in-cluster `ClusterIP` Service (the
standalone runtime default is `-1`, disabled). Network reachability is not
authorization — that `ClusterIP` Service is reachable cluster-wide with no caller
authentication. Deployers should restrict these interfaces to authorized workloads
and namespaces (for example with a NetworkPolicy) and verify that isolation. Where
an interface offers its own authentication, enable it as defense in depth — but
treat it as additional hardening within the boundary, not a replacement for network
isolation. See each component's documentation for its specific listeners and
controls.

## Securing Model and Backend Code

Dynamo loads models, tokenizers, chat templates, and (depending on the backend)
executable model code. Treat all of these as code that runs with the worker's
privileges.

- **Load models only from trusted sources.** Restrict which model repositories and
  registries workers may pull from, and restrict write access to any shared model
  cache or storage so that only trusted principals can publish artifacts.
- **Be deliberate about remote code execution options.** Framework options that
  execute model-supplied Python (for example, `trust_remote_code`) should be
  enabled only for models you trust. A pre-existing `trust_remote_code` /
  `--trust-remote-code` flag in a deployment template or worker config does **not**
  by itself indicate that a deployer reviewed and approved it — some stock
  templates ship it — so audit templates and pin the provenance of any such flag.
- **Pin what you run.** Pin container images by digest and models to an immutable
  commit/revision (or a reviewed local snapshot), and review generated deployment
  configuration rather than trusting a templated flag to reflect your intent.
- **Validate request-derived values.** When integrating or extending Dynamo,
  validate values taken from a request before using them in security-sensitive
  operations such as outbound network requests, file paths, or deserialization.

## Running with Least Privilege

### Kubernetes deployments

- Use **RBAC** and grant each component's ServiceAccount only the permissions it
  needs. The Dynamo Operator ships with scoped roles; do not broaden them.
- Apply **NetworkPolicies** so the internal communication planes, the workers, and the
  NIXL/RDMA fabric are reachable only by the components that need them, and never
  from outside the cluster boundary. The operator does not ship a NetworkPolicy by
  default.
- Run pods as **non-root** with a read-only root filesystem where possible, drop
  unneeded Linux capabilities, and set resource limits.

### Standalone Docker deployments

Apply standard Docker hardening: restrict container network access to the trusted
segment, set CPU/memory limits, avoid `--privileged`, drop unneeded capabilities,
and run as a non-root user.
