subtitle: How the replay harness composes simulated engines, routing, and Planner behavior
---

DynoSim connects a workload driver to one or more Mocker engine cores and records request and token
timing for analysis. The unified `aisimulate predict` and `aisimulate recommend` commands run this
simulation offline. The former public Replay online CLI is unavailable, although the Python replay
SDK retains online mode. The separate `python3 -m dynamo.mocker` command launches live Mocker
workers without replay orchestration.

For task-oriented instructions, see [Run a DynoSim Simulation](../../../../cli/operations/simulation-with-dynosim/dynosim-replay.mdx),
[Sweep DynoSim Configurations](../../../../cli/operations/simulation-with-dynosim/dynosim-sweeps.mdx), and
[Benchmark Planner Decisions](../../../../kubernetes/operations/simulation-with-dynosim/dynosim-planner-replay.mdx). For engine-core details, see
[Mocker Engine Architecture](../../modular-components/backends/mocker/mocker-engine-architecture.md).

## Replay harness

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    LD["Trace or synthetic load driver"] --> H["DynoSim replay harness"]
    H --> SES["Single-engine simulation"]
    H --> MES["Multi-engine simulation"]
    SES --> H
    MES --> H
    H --> TC["Trace collector and reports"]
```

The load driver supplies either a trace or a generated workload. The harness admits requests into a
simulated configuration, advances the simulation, and passes lifecycle timing to the trace
collector. The collector produces the AIPerf-style terminal summary and JSON report.

Aggregated simulation uses one event loop for single-worker, multi-worker, and attention-DP
deployments. Disaggregated simulation uses separate prefill and decode pools. The same replay
boundary also supports KV routing and Planner-in-the-loop experiments.

## Trace ingestion and session reconstruction

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    M["Mooncake-compatible JSONL"] --> MP["Mooncake parser"]
    D["Dynamo request-trace shards"] --> DP["dynamo.request.trace.v1 parser"]
    MP --> N["Normalized replay workload"]
    DP --> B{"agent_context on every request?"}
    B -->|No| S["Standard request model"]
    B -->|Yes| A["Agent-aware session model"]
    S --> N
    A --> N
    N --> LD["Load driver"]
```

Mooncake-compatible formats carry request timing, token lengths, prefix hashes, and optional session
or dependency fields. Dynamo request traces are loaded directly from one or more JSONL or JSONL.GZ
shards. The loader maps Dynamo's sequence-aware hashes to compact replay IDs without writing an
intermediate Mooncake file and validates that every shard uses the same embedded trace block size.

Context-free Dynamo records become independent requests. When every request contains
`agent_context`, the loader reconstructs session dependencies and tool waits. It rejects mixed traces
instead of silently dropping agent relationships. This path preserves session identity exported by
supported agent harnesses, including parent and child sessions.

## Component composition

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph CORE["Mocker engine core"]
        S["Scheduler model"] --> F["Forward-pass timing model"]
        S --> K["KV block manager"]
    end

    T["Prefill/decode KV handoff simulation"]
    R["KV router simulation"]
    P["Planner simulation adapter"]
    SES["Single-engine simulation"]
    MES["Multi-engine simulation"]

    SES --> CORE
    MES --> CORE
    MES --> T
    MES --> R
    MES --> P
```

The engine core owns scheduling, KV allocation, prefix caching, preemption, and forward-pass timing.
The multi-engine layer adds behavior that requires coordination across engine instances.

## Execution model

Offline execution drives Mocker engine cores directly. It uses a logical clock and does not require
a frontend, worker registration, etcd, NATS, or HTTP traffic. This path is appropriate for fast,
repeatable configuration comparisons and continuous-integration tests.

Run `python3 -m dynamo.mocker` for the supported live worker CLI. The Python replay SDK retains
online mode for programmatic callers, but no public Replay CLI currently exposes online replay
orchestration.

## Routing simulation

Round-robin simulation assigns requests without KV-aware scoring. KV-router simulation layers an
in-process indexer, worker queues, and routing lifecycle events over the engine cores. Router
queueing uses simulation time in offline mode.

The router observes request admission, prefill completion, and sequence release. It can estimate
prompt-side load from token counts or an AIConfigurator timing model. These estimates influence
worker selection but do not replace the engine scheduler's own queue and KV-cache behavior.

Policy-class replay uses the same policy-family and cache-bucket model as the live router:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R["Replay request"] --> C{"policy_class"}
    C -->|Exact explicit class| Q["Physical policy queue"]
    C -->|Known family| B["Observed uncached-ISL bucket"]
    C -->|Missing or unknown| F["default_policy_family"]
    F --> B
    B --> Q
    Q --> D["Deficit round-robin dispatch"]
```

The trace loader preserves `policy_class` metadata for the replay runtime. The unified public YAML
does not expose the former startup policy-file and `--model-name` CLI controls.

## Planner simulation adapter

Planner-in-the-loop simulation supplies traffic observations from the replay harness instead of
Prometheus. On each Planner traffic tick, the adapter reports:

| Replay metric | Planner meaning |
|---|---|
| `num_req` | Completed requests in the observation window |
| `avg_isl` / `avg_osl` | Mean raw input and output lengths |
| `avg_kv_hit_rate` | Mean router prefix-cache hit rate at admission |
| `avg_accept_length` | Mean visible output tokens per decode request-forward |

KV hit rate and speculative accept length use last-value semantics in the Planner. Missing accept
length samples preserve the previous valid value. Without valid speculative-decoding metadata, the
effective accept length is `1.0`.

Speculative decoding changes the Planner's effective decode latency and capacity calculations. It
does not rewrite raw output length, which remains the input for KV residency, context-length, and
request-length calculations.

The simulation adapter cannot auto-detect the GPU count from a deployment. Planner experiments must
set `prefill_engine_num_gpu` and `decode_engine_num_gpu` explicitly when cumulative GPU-hours are
part of the analysis.

## Timing models

DynoSim can use the default AIConfigurator-backed timing model or explicit fixed and polynomial
timing from `engine.workers.<role>.timing`. The timing model predicts prefill and decode duration.
The Mocker engine still owns batching, KV-cache state, prefix reuse, preemption, and request
progression.

AIConfigurator compatibility APIs from the `aisimulate` wheel are used in two distinct places:

- `engine.workers.<role>.timing.type: default` configures the Mocker forward-pass timing model
- `router.prefill_load_model.type: aic` configures router-side prompt-load estimation

Keeping these paths separate makes it possible to test router estimates independently from engine
timing.
