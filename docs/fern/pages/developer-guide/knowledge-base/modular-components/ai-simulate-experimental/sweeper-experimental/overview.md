Sweeper searches deployment configurations with a black-box optimizer. It turns every suggestion
into a versioned `ReplaySpec`, sends that specification to an injected `RunnerFactory`, and returns
ranked candidates or a Pareto front.

The `aisimulate` package owns only backend-neutral simulation behavior. Optional feature packages
can register a `SweepConfigProvider` that contributes search dimensions and materializes its part
of a replay. Sweeper imports a provider only when its adapter name appears in the configuration.

## Start Here

- [Quickstart](quickstart.md) runs a small backend-neutral sweep.
- [Tutorial](tutorial.md) explains a complete sweep configuration.
- [Architecture](architecture.md) shows the provider, replay, and worker boundaries.
- [Configuration](configuration.md) describes core and adapter-owned search spaces.
- [Traffic](traffic.md) defines trace, request-rate, concurrency, and KV-load workloads.
- [Optimization Goals](optimization-goals.md) defines scalar and Pareto objectives.
- [Results](results.md) describes `ReplaySpec` and `Candidate` output.
- [Sweep Configuration Providers](sweep-config-provider.md) documents the extension ABI.

## Python Entry Point

`Sweeper` is the only public execution interface. Supply a replay runtime explicitly:

```python
from aisimulate.sweeper import SmartSearchConfig, Sweeper

config = SmartSearchConfig.from_yaml("sweep.yaml")
candidates = Sweeper(runner_factory=my_runner_factory).run(config)
```

For the public YAML contract and stack discovery, use `aisimulate recommend --config
recommendation.yaml`. The `Sweeper` class remains available for callers that need the legacy Python
SDK configuration and an explicitly injected runtime.

## Compatibility

- A provider is imported only when its adapter name appears under `adapters`.
- The runner advertises supported `ReplaySpec` versions, backend/topology pairs, and runtime hooks
  before a study starts.
- Every `Sweeper.run` call owns fresh optimizer studies, result caches, runners, and worker pools.
- KVBM search fields are rejected. The AISimulate engine and replay path do not support those
  fields and provide no adapter migration for the old host or disk offload settings.
