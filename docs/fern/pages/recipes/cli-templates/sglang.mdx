title: SGLang Local Deployment Examples
subtitle: Copyable commands for running the SGLang launch scripts in the Dynamo repository.
---

Clone the NVIDIA Dynamo repository before running an example. The launch scripts load supporting
files through paths relative to `examples/backends/sglang`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo.git
cd dynamo/examples/backends/sglang
```

Review the selected script and confirm its model, GPU, and environment requirements before running
the command. Pass supported flags after the script name to override its defaults.
