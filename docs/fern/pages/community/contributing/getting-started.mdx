subtitle: Set up a fork and create a signed, validated change
---

Use this tutorial to prepare a local checkout and create your first contribution. For the policy
that determines whether you should open an issue first, see [Contribution Flow](contribution-flow.mdx).

<Steps toc={true}>
  <Step title="Choose a contribution">
    Browse [good first issues](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/labels/good-first-issue),
    [help wanted issues](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/labels/help-wanted), or the complete
    [issue list](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues).

    You can submit typo corrections and other focused fixes directly. Before beginning a feature,
    broad refactor, or architectural change, follow the issue-first guidance in
    [Contribution Flow](contribution-flow.mdx#decide-whether-to-open-an-issue).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fork and clone the repository">
    [Fork the Dynamo repository](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/fork), then clone your fork and
    add the upstream repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dynamo.git
    cd dynamo
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo.git
    git fetch upstream
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare the development environment">
    Follow [Building from Source](../../developer-guide/advanced-customizations/building-from-source.md) for system packages,
    Rust, Python, and build instructions.

    You can also use the repository's
    [development container](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/main/.devcontainer) for a
    preconfigured environment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install pre-commit hooks">
    Install the hooks once in your checkout:

    ```bash
    uv pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    ```

    Before committing, run the hooks against the files in your change:

    ```bash
    pre-commit run
    ```

    Use `pre-commit run --all-files` when you need to validate the entire repository.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DCO sign-off and commit signing">
    Configure the name and email that should appear in your commits:

    ```bash
    git config user.name "Your Name"
    git config user.email "you@example.com"
    ```

    Every commit must include a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off. Add it with `-s`:

    ```bash
    git commit -s -m "fix(component): describe the change"
    ```

    For automatic trusted-CI approval of a fork pull request, configure
    [GitHub-supported commit signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
    too. GitHub must show every commit in the pull request as `Verified`; `git commit -s` adds a
    DCO sign-off but does not add a cryptographic signature. Signing does not itself qualify a
    pull request for automatic approval. A maintainer can instead review the current head and
    comment `/ok to test <sha>` to start CI.

    For the full requirement and repair instructions, see
    [DCO and Licensing](dco-and-licensing.md).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the commit">
    Confirm that the latest commit message contains a `Signed-off-by` trailer:

    ```bash
    git show -s --format='%B' HEAD
    ```

    The output must end with a line like:

    ```text
    Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
    ```

    Then inspect the change you are about to submit:

    ```bash
    git status
    git diff upstream/main...HEAD
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue to the pull request flow">
    Follow [Contribution Flow](contribution-flow.mdx) to decide whether an issue is required, push
    your branch, open the pull request, and work through CI and review.
  </Step>
</Steps>
