title: Contribution Flow
subtitle: Take a change from proposal through pull request review
---

This guide describes the normal contribution path after your local environment is ready. If you
have not prepared a fork or configured commit sign-off, begin with
[Getting Started](getting-started.mdx).

## Decide Whether to Open an Issue

Small, focused changes can usually go directly to a pull request. Examples include typo fixes,
documentation corrections, small bug fixes, and narrow configuration changes.

Open a [Contribution Request](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/new?template=contribution_request.yml)
before implementation when a change is large, introduces a feature, spans multiple components, or
would benefit from agreement on the approach. Wait for maintainer approval before investing in a
substantial implementation.

Changes that modify public APIs, communication-plane architecture, backend integration contracts,
or multiple major components require a
[Dynamo Enhancement Proposal (DEP)](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/enhancements).

## Submit and Refine the Change

<Steps toc={true}>
  <Step title="Create a focused branch">
    Update your local `main` branch and create a descriptive branch:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git switch main
    git rebase upstream/main
    git switch -c yourname/fix-router-timeout
    ```

    Keep one concern per branch and pull request.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement and validate">
    Make the smallest complete change that solves the problem. Add or update tests when behavior
    changes, and run the relevant checks from [Code Quality](code-quality.md).

    Commit each logical change with DCO sign-off:

    ```bash
    git commit -s -m "fix(router): handle streaming timeout"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the pull request">
    Push your branch to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push -u origin yourname/fix-router-timeout
    ```

    [Open a pull request](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/compare) against `main`. Link the
    approved issue when one exists. Use a Conventional Commit title, such as
    `fix(router): handle streaming timeout`, and include **Summary** and **Validation** sections in
    the pull request description.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete automated review and CI">
    Respond to actionable automated review comments and fix failing checks.

    For a fork pull request, automatic trusted-CI approval requires the contributor or latest
    branch update to meet repository approval criteria and every PR commit to have a cryptographic
    signature that GitHub reports as `Verified`.
    `git commit -s` adds a DCO sign-off but does not add a cryptographic signature. Signing does
    not itself qualify a pull request for automatic approval. When automatic approval is
    unavailable, a maintainer can review the current head and comment `/ok to test <sha>` to start
    CI. Wait for that action rather than repeatedly pushing unchanged commits.

    <Info>
    You are responsible for understanding and validating all submitted code, including code
    produced with AI assistance.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request and address review">
    Request review from the maintainer who approved the issue when applicable. The teams that own
    the areas your pull request touches are auto-requested when it opens; preview them with
    `python .github/codeowners/who_owns.py --codeowners CODEOWNERS --changed`. Any one owner per
    matched rule satisfies the gate.

    If the `codeowners` check fails because your pull request adds a directory no area claims, add a
    one-line claim under the owning area in
    [`areas.yaml`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/.github/codeowners/areas.yaml),
    regenerate, and commit both files together — see the
    [CODEOWNERS README](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/.github/codeowners/README.md).

    Respond to review comments, push follow-up commits with DCO sign-off, and re-request review when
    the change is ready.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Keep the branch current">
    If the target branch advances or the pull request develops conflicts, rebase on the current
    upstream branch:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main
    git push --force-with-lease
    ```

    Recheck DCO trailers after rewriting commits. See
    [DCO and Licensing](dco-and-licensing.md#verify-every-commit) for a branch-wide check.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Issue and Review States

Common issue labels communicate the next action:

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `needs-triage` | Maintainers have not completed initial review |
| `needs-info` | The issue needs more information from its author |
| `approved-for-pr` | The proposed implementation can proceed |
| `in-progress` | A contributor is working on the issue |
| `blocked` | Progress depends on another change or decision |

Review timing depends on the size, risk, and maintainer availability. If a pull request has had no
activity for a week, leave a concise follow-up comment or contact the approving maintainer.
