title: Dynamo Profiler
subtitle: How the profiler turns a DynamoGraphDeploymentRequest into a sized deployment — the pipeline, the two search modes, and what it optimizes for.
---

The profiler is the engine behind [Auto Deploy with DGDR](auto-deploy-with-dgdr.md). When you submit a [DynamoGraphDeploymentRequest (DGDR)](../../reference/kubernetes-api/dynamo-graph-deployment-request.mdx), the profiler analyzes your model, hardware, and SLA targets, chooses a parallelization strategy for the prefill and decode engines, and generates the [DynamoGraphDeployment (DGD)](../../reference/kubernetes-api/dynamo-graph-deployment.mdx) that serves traffic.

The [DGDR walkthrough](auto-deploy-with-dgdr.md) is enough to deploy a model. This page is for the next level: understanding what the profiler does with your request, choosing between the two search modes deliberately, and reading what the profiler decided. It assumes you have already authored a DGDR — it does not re-cover spec fields, `autoApply`, model caching, or monitoring, which the walkthrough and the [DGDR Reference](../../reference/kubernetes-api/dynamo-graph-deployment-request.mdx) already document.

## The profiling pipeline

The profiler runs as a Kubernetes Job while the DGDR sits in the `Profiling` phase. The stages below map to the sub-phases you can watch with `kubectl get dgdr <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.profilingPhase}'`.

<Steps toc={true} tocDepth={2}>

<Step title="Validate the request">

*Sub-phase: `Initializing`.*

The profiler checks required fields (`model`, and resolved `hardware`), verifies the SLA is internally consistent, and applies the [constraints](#constraints). Invalid requests fail here before any GPU is touched.

</Step>

<Step title="Search for candidate configurations">

*Sub-phases: `SweepingPrefill`, `SweepingDecode`.*

The profiler sweeps parallelization mappings for the prefill and decode engines independently, bounded by a minimum GPU count (set by the model size and GPU VRAM) and a maximum (one node for dense models, up to four nodes for MoE). Which mappings it tries depends on the model architecture — see [Model and parallelization support](#model-and-parallelization-support).

How each candidate is scored depends on the [search strategy](#search-strategy): [rapid](#rapid) estimates each candidate with AI Configurator (AIC) simulation, while [thorough](#thorough) deploys each candidate as a real engine and measures it.

</Step>

<Step title="Pick the best configuration">

*Sub-phase: `SelectingConfig`.*

The profiler selects the prefill and decode engine configuration that satisfies your SLA. *What* it optimizes for — minimum GPUs, maximum throughput, or independent engines for the Planner to scale — is chosen automatically from your spec. See [How the profiler picks a configuration](#how-the-profiler-picks-a-configuration).

In rapid mode the profiler runs AIConfigurator in-process, so its ranked candidate tables appear directly in the profiling job logs (`kubectl logs -f <profiling-pod>`). For a `backend: auto` request, AIConfigurator compares aggregated against disaggregated and prints a ranked table per serving mode — abridged here (real tables carry more columns, and the winning row names the concrete backend):

```text
agg Top Configurations: (Sorted by tokens/s/gpu)
+------+--------------+---------------+--------+----------+--------------+-------------+----------+
| Rank | tokens/s/gpu | tokens/s/user |  TTFT  | replicas | gpus/replica | gpus/worker | parallel |
+------+--------------+---------------+--------+----------+--------------+-------------+----------+
|  1   |    410.22    |     108.48    | 251.10 |    8     |      4       | 4 (=4x1x1)  |  tp4pp1  |
|  2   |    361.33    |     107.43    | 224.48 |    4     |      8       | 8 (=8x1x1)  |  tp8pp1  |
+------+--------------+---------------+--------+----------+--------------+-------------+----------+

disagg Top Configurations: (Sorted by tokens/s/gpu)
+------+--------------+---------------+--------+----------+------------+-------------+------------+-------------+
| Rank | tokens/s/gpu | tokens/s/user |  TTFT  | replicas | (p)workers | (p)parallel | (d)workers | (d)parallel |
+------+--------------+---------------+--------+----------+------------+-------------+------------+-------------+
|  1   |    684.79    |     100.31    | 295.71 |    4     |     2      |    tp2pp1   |     1      |    tp4pp1   |
|  2   |    684.79    |     100.16    | 295.71 |    2     |     4      |    tp2pp1   |     1      |    tp8pp1   |
+------+--------------+---------------+--------+----------+------------+-------------+------------+-------------+
```

Read the tables the same way as the [AIConfigurator sizing walkthrough](../disaggregated-serving/sizing-with-aiconfigurator.mdx#read-the-recommended-parallelism): `parallel` is the tensor- and pipeline-parallel layout (`tp4pp1` means TP 4, PP 1), `gpus/worker` equals TP × PP, and the disaggregated table sizes prefill `(p)` and decode `(d)` engines separately. The profiler takes the rank-1 row of the winning experiment and renders it into the generated DGD.

</Step>

<Step title="Build interpolation curves">

*Sub-phase: `BuildingCurves`.*

When the deployment will run the [Planner](../../developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/planner/planner-guide.md) or a [mocker backend](#simulate-without-gpus), the profiler builds detailed performance curves for the selected engines — TTFT versus input length for prefill, and ITL versus KV-cache utilization and context length for decode. Rapid mode derives these from AIC; thorough mode measures them on the selected engines. Deployments that need neither the Planner nor mocker skip this stage.

</Step>

<Step title="Generate the DGD">

*Sub-phases: `GeneratingDGD`, `Done`.*

The picked configuration is rendered into a complete DGD — parallelism, replica counts, image, and volume mounts. The profiler then assembles the final output in layers: a mocker template replaces the engine base if mocker is enabled, a `Planner` component and its config are injected if the Planner is enabled, and interpolation data is attached as a ConfigMap where the Planner or mocker needs it. The result lands in `status.profilingResults.selectedConfig`, and the operator deploys it when `autoApply: true`.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Search Strategy

The `searchStrategy` field controls how the profiler scores candidates during the search stage — simulated versus measured. It trades profiling time against accuracy.

### Rapid

Rapid is the default. It scores candidate configurations with AIC simulation instead of deploying engines, so it finishes in about 30 seconds and consumes no GPUs during profiling.

```yaml
spec:
  searchStrategy: rapid
```

Reach for rapid when you are getting started, iterating on SLA targets, or running in CI. It supports all three backends and both aggregated and disaggregated topologies. The tradeoff is accuracy: results are estimated, and unusual configurations can carry error.

If AIC does not support your model, GPU SKU, and backend combination, the profiler falls back to a naive memory-fit calculation and logs `AIC does not support this combo — falling back to naive config generation`. The fallback may not be optimal and skips the ranked tables above, so confirm your SKU is in the [Profiler support matrix](../../developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/profiler/profiler-guide.md#support-matrix) first.

### Thorough

Thorough enumerates candidate parallelization mappings, deploys each as a real Kubernetes workload, and benchmarks it with AIPerf. It produces measured rather than estimated data, at the cost of 2–4 hours and real GPU capacity during profiling.

```yaml
spec:
  searchStrategy: thorough
  backend: vllm      # a concrete backend is required
```

Use thorough when tuning for production, when your hardware is outside the AIC support matrix, or when you need measured numbers. It carries two hard constraints that the profiler rejects at validation:

- **Disaggregated only** — thorough does not evaluate aggregated topologies.
- **`backend: auto` is rejected** — name `vllm`, `sglang`, or `trtllm`.

It also consumes real GPUs during profiling, since it deploys and benchmarks an engine for each candidate. After picking, thorough mode runs in-depth profiling on the selected prefill and decode engines to produce the interpolation curves — sweeping input lengths for prefill, and KV-cache load and context length for decode.

## How the profiler picks a configuration

You do not choose a picking mode. The profiler derives it from two things you already set — whether the Planner is enabled, and whether you gave it a target load — and optimizes accordingly.

| The profiler optimizes for | When | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Independent engines for autoscaling** | The Planner is enabled (`features.planner` is set) | Picks prefill and decode engines separately, each at 1 replica; the Planner scales them at runtime |
| **Fewest GPUs that meet the load** | A target load is set (`workload.requestRate` or `workload.concurrency`) and the Planner is not enabled | Finds the configuration that serves the target load under SLA with the minimum GPUs |
| **Maximum throughput** | Neither of the above | Maximizes throughput for the available GPU budget under SLA |

The Planner takes precedence: if you set both a Planner and a target load, the profiler optimizes for autoscaling. To size for a fixed load instead, leave the Planner out and set `workload.requestRate` or `workload.concurrency`.

> [!NOTE]
> The picking mode is a Dynamo profiler concept, not an AIConfigurator setting — there is no picking-mode field on the DGDR and no matching flag on the `aiconfigurator` CLI. The profiler derives the mode from your spec and sets the objective it hands to AIConfigurator; AIConfigurator then ranks candidate layouts against that objective. The aggregated-versus-disaggregated winner and the rank-1 row in the [ranked tables](#pick-the-best-configuration) are AIConfigurator's ranking *within* the mode the profiler selected.

## Model and parallelization support

The profiler supports dense and MoE models, with MoE coverage depending on the backend:

| Backend | Dense models | MoE models |
|---|---|---|
| vLLM | ✅ | 🚧 |
| SGLang | ✅ | ✅ |
| TensorRT-LLM | ✅ | 🚧 |

Which parallelization mappings it sweeps depends on the model architecture:

| Model architecture | Prefill mappings | Decode mappings |
|---|---|---|
| MLA + MoE (DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-V3.2) | TEP, DEP | TEP, DEP |
| GQA + MoE (Qwen3-MoE) | TP, TEP, DEP | TP, TEP, DEP |
| Dense | TP | TP |

> [!NOTE]
> Exact model × mapping support depends on the backend. The profiler does not guarantee that the recommended prefill/decode configuration is supported and bug-free on the chosen backend. For MoE, prefer SGLang for full support.

## Constraints

Beyond the strategy-specific rules covered under [Thorough](#thorough), the profiler enforces these at validation, before any GPUs are used:

- **`sla.e2eLatency` cannot be combined with an explicit `sla.ttft` or `sla.itl`** — provide only one form. The request is rejected otherwise.
- **An unachievable SLA is handled per search strategy, and SLA targets are never relaxed.** With `searchStrategy: rapid`, profiling fails and no DGD is generated when no AIC experiment returns an SLA-feasible configuration (architectures AIC does not support fall back to the naive estimator instead). With `searchStrategy: thorough`, the profiler selects the closest measured configuration and logs a warning naming the best achievable latency. The generated DGD carries the SLA you submitted. The planner config carries your `sla.ttft` and `sla.itl` unless `features.planner` sets explicit values, which take precedence, and an `sla.e2eLatency` target is not propagated to the planner. See [SLA Cannot Be Met](../../developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/profiler/profiler-guide.md#sla-cannot-be-met) in the Profiler guide.
- **A target load that exceeds the GPU budget is not fatal.** The profiler logs a warning and returns its best effort within budget.
- **A model that spans more GPUs than one node provides needs a gang scheduler** (Grove or LWS); see [Multinode Orchestration](../installation/multinode-orchestration.md).

## Simulate without GPUs

To validate a configuration or exercise Planner behavior at scale without real engines, enable the mocker backend. The profiler swaps the real-engine base for a mocker template that registers workers and replays modeled performance, so no GPUs are needed to run the deployment.

```yaml
spec:
  model: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
  backend: vllm
  features:
    mocker:
      enabled: true
```

Mocker is a testing and experimentation path, not a serving deployment. It is independent of `searchStrategy` — enabling it does not change or override rapid versus thorough, and the profiler still runs the search strategy you set. The one interaction is with the Planner: when you enable mocker **alongside the Planner**, the Planner's pre-deployment sweeping cannot be `none`, because the mocker needs the simulated performance data that sweeping produces. Without a Planner, mocker carries no such requirement. Profiler-managed deployments and the public `python3 -m dynamo.mocker` command use the same live Mocker worker runtime.

## Accessing profiling artifacts

By default the profiler writes only its output — the generated DGD, and interpolation data when the Planner or mocker needs it — to ConfigMaps. For the full record of a run (performance plots, per-candidate configs, AIPerf results, raw `.npz` data, and logs), attach a PVC to the profiling Job through `overrides.profilingJob`:

```yaml
spec:
  overrides:
    profilingJob:
      template:
        spec:
          containers: []    # required placeholder; leave empty to inherit defaults
          volumes:
            - name: profiling-output
              persistentVolumeClaim:
                claimName: dynamo-pvc
```

Copy the results off the PVC with a temporary access pod:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/utils/manifests/pvc-access-pod.yaml -n <namespace>
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod/pvc-access-pod -n <namespace> --timeout=60s
kubectl cp <namespace>/pvc-access-pod:/data ./profiling-results
kubectl delete pod pvc-access-pod -n <namespace>
```

The interpolation `.npz` files are the same data the Planner consumes for autoscaling decisions. For their array schema and how the Planner uses them, see the [Planner Guide](../../developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/planner/planner-guide.md).
