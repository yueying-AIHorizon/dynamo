title: Fast Model Weight Loading
subtitle: Cut cold-start weight-load time on shared PVC storage with a concurrent loader and correct filesystem layout
---

Loading a large checkpoint from a shared PVC into GPU memory can dominate cold start. A 1T-parameter model is hundreds of GiB on disk; with the wrong loader and the wrong filesystem layout it can take over an hour, even on storage that advertises multiple GB/s. This page explains the two independent bottlenecks and how to fix both, with a measured end-to-end example.

Use the [Model Storage Overview](../../installation/model-storage/overview.md) to choose and provision shared storage. This page covers the next step: making each worker read model weights from that storage efficiently.

## TL;DR

Two stacked bottlenecks slow a cold weight load off a shared filesystem:

1. **The loader's access pattern (usually dominant).** The default safetensors loader reads single-stream with small effective I/O. On a parallel filesystem this leaves most of the bandwidth idle.
2. **The filesystem layout.** On a striped/parallel filesystem (Lustre, and similar), a file that lives on a single storage target is capped at that one target's bandwidth no matter how much aggregate the filesystem has.

Fix both:

- **Loader:** add `--load-format runai_streamer` to the vLLM worker (concurrent, multi-threaded, large-block reader; already shipped in Dynamo vLLM runtime images).
- **Layout (Lustre):** stripe the model files across all storage targets — set the directory default *before* download so files are born wide, or restripe existing files in place with `lfs migrate`.

In a measured 554 GiB / TP16 deployment these two changes together cut weight load from **~76 min to ~5 min (~14×)** with no re-download. See [Case study](#case-study-kimi-k27-code-554-gib-on-amlfs) below.

## Background: why a cold load is slow

### Bottleneck 1 — loader access pattern

vLLM's default loader (`--load-format auto`) memory-maps each safetensors shard and copies tensors out largely single-stream. The effective read is latency-bound against remote storage — small requests at shallow queue depth — so it never fills the pipe. Concurrency and block size both matter: on one Azure Managed Lustre (AMLFS) filesystem, a cache-bypassed `dd` of a single shard measured:

| Block size | Throughput (single storage target) |
|-----------:|------------------------------------|
| 128 KiB    | ~228 MB/s |
| 1 MiB      | ~854 MB/s |
| 16 MiB     | ~1.6 GB/s |

The default loader sits near the top of that table (small reads), which is why a real load measured only **~124 MB/s effective** — over an order of magnitude below what the same storage delivers to a large-block reader.

**`runai-model-streamer`** (the `runai_streamer` load format) replaces this with a pool of worker threads issuing large, concurrent reads, saturating the storage instead of waiting on it. The package ships in Dynamo's vLLM runtime images.

### Bottleneck 2 — filesystem striping (Lustre)

A parallel filesystem spreads data across multiple **OSTs** (Object Storage Targets — the backing storage volumes). The filesystem's advertised throughput is the *sum* across all OSTs; you only reach it when many OSTs work in parallel. A file's layout has two knobs:

- **stripe_count** — how many OSTs the file's bytes are spread across.
- **stripe_size** — the chunk written to one OST before moving to the next.

The default `stripe_count` is often **1** — each file lives entirely on one OST. A single-file read is then capped at one OST's bandwidth, regardless of the filesystem's aggregate. Striping a file across *all* OSTs lets even one sequential reader pull from all of them at once.

On the same AMLFS (4 OSTs, ~2 GB/s each, 8 GB/s aggregate), large-block read of one shard:

| Layout | Throughput |
|--------|------------|
| `stripe_count=1` (default) | ~2.0 GB/s (one OST) |
| `stripe_count=4` (all OSTs) | ~6.4 GB/s (~3.2×) |

<Warning>
Striping only helps once the reader issues large, concurrent I/O. Wide striping with the default single-stream loader barely moves the needle, and a fast loader on stripe-1 files is still capped at one OST. **You need both fixes** — they multiply.
</Warning>

## How many stripes? (OSTs and capacity)

The maximum useful `stripe_count` is the **number of OSTs** in the filesystem — you cannot stripe a file across more OSTs than exist. Use `stripe_count=-1` to mean "all available OSTs."

The OST count scales with **provisioned capacity**, not the SKU alone. AMLFS provisions roughly **1 OST per 4 TiB** (this matches the 500-SKU's 4 TB capacity increment). So aggregate bandwidth and max stripe width grow only as you buy more TiB:

| Capacity (AMLFS-500) | ~OSTs | Max stripe | Aggregate throughput |
|---------------------:|------:|-----------:|----------------------|
| 16 TiB  | 4  | 4  | ~8 GB/s |
| 32 TiB  | 8  | 8  | ~16 GB/s |
| 128 TiB | ~32 | ~32 | ~64 GB/s |

Check the live OST count on any Lustre mount with `lfs df` (see [Inspecting and setting stripe layout](#inspecting-and-setting-stripe-layout)).

## Backend support

`runai_streamer` is a **vLLM** load format. Striping is filesystem-level and helps every backend, because they all read the same safetensors off the same mount.

| Backend | Concurrent streaming loader | Benefits from striping |
|---------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| **vLLM** | ✅ `--load-format runai_streamer` (in-image) | ✅ |
| **SGLang** | ❌ not in SGLang's `--load-format` choices | ✅ |
| **TensorRT-LLM** | ❌ no streaming loader, but parallel weight loading is on by default | ✅ |

For SGLang and TensorRT-LLM, the striping fix alone still helps; there is no `runai_streamer` equivalent to add.

## Runbook: a new model on Lustre storage

This is the end-to-end procedure for bringing up a new large model on a Lustre-backed PVC with both optimizations from the start.

<Steps toc={true}>
  <Step title="Stripe the cache directory before downloading">

Lustre sets a file's layout at **creation time**, so the cheapest approach is to widen the target directory first — every file the download writes then inherits wide striping, and you never have to rewrite anything.

From any pod that has the `lfs` client and mounts the PVC:

```bash
# -1 = stripe across all OSTs; 4 MiB stripe chunk suits large sequential shards
lfs setstripe -c -1 -S 4M /mnt/model-cache/hub
```

<Note>
`lfs setstripe` on a directory sets the **default layout for new files**; it does not move existing data. Run it before the download Job. If the `hub/` subdirectory does not exist yet, create it (or set the layout on the PVC root) so the default is inherited.
</Note>

If your downloader image lacks the `lfs` client (for example `python:3.12-slim`), either add `lustre-client-utils` to it, or run the `lfs setstripe` from a separate short-lived pod that has the client before you start the download Job.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Download the model">

Run your normal PVC download Job. Because the directory default is now wide, every shard lands striped across all OSTs.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the streaming loader in the DGD">

Add the load format and (optionally) a concurrency hint to the vLLM worker:

```yaml
services:
  worker:
    extraPodSpec:
      mainContainer:
        args:
          - --model
          - <org>/<model>
          - --load-format
          - runai_streamer
        env:
          # Parallel read streams per rank. Raise to keep all OSTs saturated;
          # lower if you see host-RAM pressure. Docs default is 8.
          - name: RUNAI_STREAMER_CONCURRENCY
            value: "16"
```

<Note>
Unlike `--load-format modelexpress`, `runai_streamer` still expects the weights present on the mounted path — Dynamo prefetches/uses the local cache as usual. It changes *how the files are read*, not *where they come from*. No ModelExpress server or `VLLM_PLUGINS` setting is required.
</Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the load time">

Watch the worker log for the streamer and the load-time line:

```bash
kubectl logs <worker-leader-pod> | grep -iE "Runai Model Streamer|Loading weights took|Model loading took"
```

You should see `Loading safetensors using Runai Model Streamer: ...` during load and a final `Model loading took N seconds`. Compare against a baseline run without the flag to confirm the speedup.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Fixing an already-downloaded model (no re-download)

If the weights are already on the PVC with the default `stripe_count=1`, you do **not** need to re-download. `lfs migrate` rewrites each file's data across OSTs in place, preserving the HuggingFace cache symlinks (the `blobs/` files are the real data; `snapshots/` are symlinks into them).

```bash
# Set the directory default so any FUTURE writes land wide too
lfs setstripe -c -1 -S 4M /mnt/model-cache/hub/models--<org>--<model>
lfs setstripe -c -1 -S 4M /mnt/model-cache/hub/models--<org>--<model>/blobs

# Restripe the existing blob data in place (idempotent: skips already-wide files)
osts=$(lfs df /mnt/model-cache | awk '/OST:/ {n++} END {print n+0}')
for f in /mnt/model-cache/hub/models--<org>--<model>/blobs/*; do
  c=$(lfs getstripe -c "$f")
  [ "$c" -lt "$osts" ] && lfs migrate -c -1 -S 4M "$f"
done
```

### Verify integrity for free

HuggingFace LFS blob **filenames are the file's SHA-256**. After migrating you can confirm the data is bit-identical at zero extra bookkeeping cost:

```bash
bad=0
for f in /mnt/model-cache/hub/models--<org>--<model>/blobs/*; do
  name=$(basename "$f")
  # Only LFS blobs are named by sha256 (64 hex chars); skip small git-hash metadata blobs
  echo "$name" | grep -qE '^[0-9a-f]{64}$' || continue
  calc=$(sha256sum "$f" | awk '{print $1}')
  if [ "$calc" = "$name" ]; then
    echo "OK   $name"
  else
    echo "BAD  $name"
    bad=1
  fi
done
exit "$bad"
```

`lfs migrate` is non-destructive (it writes a new layout and swaps only on success), and the mount typically carries a client-side `checksum` option, so corruption is already unlikely — the SHA-256 sweep is a cheap final gate before you reload the model on top of the restriped data.

## Inspecting and setting stripe layout

You need the `lfs` client (from `lustre-client-utils`) on a pod that mounts the PVC. The Azure Lustre CSI node image (`csi-azurelustre-node`) already contains `lfs`.

```bash
# OST count and per-OST capacity/usage
lfs df -h /mnt/model-cache

# Directory default layout (applies to new files)
lfs getstripe -d /mnt/model-cache/hub

# A specific file's layout
lfs getstripe -c -S -i /mnt/model-cache/hub/.../blobs/<sha>   # count, size, OST index
```

## Case study: Kimi-K2.7-Code, 554 GiB on AMLFS

A real bring-up: `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.7-Code` (1T-param / 32B-active MoE, native INT4), served aggregated at TP16 across two 8×H100 nodes, weights on an AMLFS-Durable-Premium-500 filesystem (16 TiB, 4 OSTs, 8 GB/s aggregate).

**Before.** Default loader, files at `stripe_count=1`: weight load took **4575 s (~76 min)** — an effective ~124 MB/s, ~1/60th of the filesystem's aggregate. Root cause split cleanly into the two bottlenecks above (loader access pattern dominant; single-OST striping secondary).

**Change.** `lfs migrate -c -1 -S 4M` across all 87 blobs (555 GiB rewritten in place in ~10 min, SHA-256 verified bit-identical, no re-download), plus `--load-format runai_streamer` with `RUNAI_STREAMER_CONCURRENCY=16` in the DGD.

**After.** On reload, weight load took **318 s (~5.3 min)** — a **~14.4× speedup** — for the identical 36.96 GiB/GPU (layout-only change; weights unchanged). The model served correctly afterward.

The larger share of the win came from the loader flag (the access pattern was the dominant bottleneck); striping stacked on top by letting those concurrent streams hit all four OSTs at once.
