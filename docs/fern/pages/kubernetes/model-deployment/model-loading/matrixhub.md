title: Load Models from MatrixHub
subtitle: Configure Dynamo on Kubernetes to retrieve model weights from an in-cluster MatrixHub registry.
---

MatrixHub is a model registry that can make model weights available inside your network.
Pointing the Hugging Face client at an in-cluster MatrixHub endpoint lets Dynamo download
a pre-cached model without retrieving the weights from the public Hugging Face service.

This guide deploys an OpenAI-compatible Dynamo service for `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` on Kubernetes.
It also describes an optional comparison against a public Hugging Face download.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that the following are available:

- A Kubernetes cluster with the Dynamo Operator installed.
- A GPU node with an NVIDIA GPU available to Kubernetes.
- An in-cluster MatrixHub registry reachable at `http://matrixhub.example.com:30001`.
- The `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` repository pre-cached in MatrixHub.
- Network access from the GPU node to `nvcr.io` and to the MatrixHub endpoint.
- A machine with `kubectl` and a kubeconfig for the cluster.

To cache the model in MatrixHub, run the following command from a host that can reach your MatrixHub deployment:

```bash
HF_ENDPOINT="http://matrixhub.example.com:30001" hf download Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
```

Replace `http://matrixhub.example.com:30001` with your MatrixHub endpoint.

## Deploy Dynamo with MatrixHub

### Connect to the cluster

Set the kubeconfig in each new terminal, then verify that the cluster is reachable:

```bash
# Replace with the path to your kubeconfig file.
export KUBECONFIG="/path/to/kubeconfig"

kubectl get nodes
```

### Create the deployment manifest

Save the following manifest as `dgd-vllm.yaml`. Replace `matrixhub.example.com:30001` and the model name as needed.
If you change the model, update both `--model` and `--served-model-name`, and ensure that the repository is available in MatrixHub.

              value: http://matrixhub.example.com:30001

          args: ["--http-port", "8000"]

          workingDir: /workspace
          env:
            - name: HF_ENDPOINT
              value: http://matrixhub.example.com:30001
          command: ["python3", "-m", "dynamo.vllm"]
          args:
            - --model
            - Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
            - --served-model-name
            - Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
            - --tensor-parallel-size
            - "1"
            - --gpu-memory-utilization
            - "0.85"
            - --max-model-len
            - "8192"
            - --no-enable-log-requests
```

`HF_ENDPOINT` directs the Hugging Face client used by the frontend and worker to MatrixHub.
The model repository and file layout must be compatible with Hugging Face Hub requests.

### Apply and monitor the deployment

```bash
kubectl apply -f dgd-vllm.yaml

kubectl -n dynamo-system get pods \
  -l nvidia.com/dynamo-graph-deployment-name=vllm-qwen -w
```

Wait for both pods to report `1/1 Running`. The first deployment can take
several minutes while Kubernetes pulls the runtime image and starts vLLM.

To inspect the model download, first identify the decode pod, then view its logs:

```bash
DECODE_POD="$(kubectl -n dynamo-system get pods \
  -l nvidia.com/dynamo-graph-deployment-name=vllm-qwen \
  -o name | grep decode)"

kubectl -n dynamo-system logs "$DECODE_POD" --tail=100
```

In the test environment, downloading the pre-cached model from MatrixHub took approximately 10 seconds.

## Verify the service

Find the frontend pod and send an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions request from inside it:

```bash
FRONTEND_POD="$(kubectl -n dynamo-system get pods \
  -l nvidia.com/dynamo-graph-deployment-name=vllm-qwen \
  -o name | grep frontend)"

kubectl -n dynamo-system exec "$FRONTEND_POD" -- \
  curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"model":"Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Introduce yourself in one sentence."}],"max_tokens":64}'
```

## Optional: compare with public Hugging Face

To measure the same deployment without MatrixHub, remove the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment-variable
block from both the `Frontend` and `decode` containers, then redeploy:

```bash
kubectl apply -f dgd-vllm.yaml
```

Without `HF_ENDPOINT`, the Hugging Face client uses its normal public endpoint.
In the test environment, downloading this model from public Hugging Face took approximately six minutes.

![Model download from public Hugging Face](../../../../assets/img/hf-download-6min.png)

| Stage | MatrixHub (model pre-cached) | Public Hugging Face |
|---|---:|---:|
| Container image pull | Seconds (cached on node) | Seconds (cached on node) |
| Model-weight download | **~10 seconds** | **~6 minutes** |
| vLLM startup and model load | 1-2 minutes | 1-2 minutes |

The comparison indicates that a nearby MatrixHub cache can substantially reduce the initial model-weight download time.
Actual results depend on model size, cache state, network bandwidth, and the container-image cache.
