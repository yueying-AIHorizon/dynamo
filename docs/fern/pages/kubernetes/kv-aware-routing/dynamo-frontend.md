subtitle: Configure the Dynamo Frontend to select the worker most likely to have the prompt prefix cached.
---

In this topology, the Dynamo Frontend receives each request and selects the worker most likely to already hold the prompt's KV cache prefix. Use it when clients send requests directly to a Dynamo Frontend Service. If a Kubernetes Gateway receives requests first, use [GAIE with Dynamo](gateway-api.mdx) instead.

Turning it on in a DynamoGraphDeployment (DGD) takes two steps: switch the **Frontend** into KV mode, and have the **workers** publish KV cache events so the router knows what each worker has cached. This is a [how-to](../model-deployment/deploy-with-dgd.md) for an existing deployment. For the routing cost model and concepts, see [Routing Concepts](../../developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/router/routing-concepts.md); for the full flag and environment-variable reference, see the [Frontend Configuration Reference](../../reference/components/frontend-configuration.mdx#router).

<Step title="Put the Frontend in KV mode">

Set `--router-mode kv` on the Frontend container, or the equivalent `DYN_ROUTER_MODE=kv` environment variable:

```yaml
spec:
  components:
  - name: Frontend
    type: frontend
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: main
          command:
          - python3
          - -m
          - dynamo.frontend
          args:
          - --router-mode
          - kv
```

That alone gives you cache-aware routing using load signals. To make routing decisions from real cache contents, complete the next step.

</Step>

<Step title="Publish KV events from the workers">

For the router to track which blocks each worker holds, workers must publish KV cache events. On a vLLM worker, add `--kv-events-config`:

```yaml
  - name: prefill
    type: prefill
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: main
          command:
          - python3
          - -m
          - dynamo.vllm
          args:
          - --model
          - Qwen/Qwen3-32B
          - --kv-events-config
          - '{"publisher":"zmq","topic":"kv-events","endpoint":"tcp://*:20080","enable_kv_cache_events":true}'
```

Setting the Frontend to `kv` mode alone does not provide worker cache state. Without worker KV events, `kv` mode uses load-only scoring. To predict cache state from routing decisions instead, set `--no-router-kv-events` on the Frontend.

The Frontend and worker snippets above are drawn from the [disagg-kv-router recipe](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/recipes/qwen3-32b/vllm/disagg-kv-router/deploy.yaml), where six prefill workers publish KV events and the Frontend routes across them.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Tuning Knobs

The KV router scores each worker as `prefill_load_scale * adjusted_prefill_blocks + decode_blocks`, where cache-overlap credit subtracts from the prefill load. Two knobs shift that balance; set them as Frontend `args` (or the `DYN_*` env equivalents). Start with the defaults and adjust only if you have a measured TTFT or ITL problem.

For the flag/env/default reference, see the [Frontend Configuration Reference](../../reference/components/frontend-configuration.mdx#router); for the full cost-model detail and every related flag, see [Configuration and Tuning](../../developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/router/configuration-and-tuning.md#tuning-guidelines).

### Cache-Overlap Credit

`--router-kv-overlap-score-credit` (env `DYN_ROUTER_KV_OVERLAP_SCORE_CREDIT`) is the primary cache-reuse knob. It credits device-local prefix overlap against a worker's prefill load, biasing requests toward workers that already hold the prompt's prefix.

- **Range:** `0.0` to `1.0`. **Default:** `1.0`.
- **Raise toward `1.0`** to prioritize cache reuse and lower TTFT — the router more aggressively co-locates requests that share a prefix.
- **Lower toward `0.0`** to spread load more evenly and lower ITL, at the cost of more redundant prefills. `0.0` ignores prefix caches entirely and skips building the local indexer (equivalent to load-only routing).

Most deployments should leave this at `1.0`. Lower it only when cache-rich workers are getting overloaded while others sit idle.

### Prompt-Side Load Weight

`--router-prefill-load-scale` (env `DYN_ROUTER_PREFILL_LOAD_SCALE`) scales the prompt-side prefill load after overlap credit is applied, setting how much prompt work counts relative to decode-side block load.

- **Minimum:** `0.0` (ignore prompt-side load). **Default:** `1.0`. No hard maximum — values above `1.0` weight prefill more heavily.
- **Raise above `1.0`** when long prompts are saturating workers and you want the router to steer new requests away from workers already doing heavy prefill.
- **Lower below `1.0`** when decode-side pressure dominates and you want routing driven mainly by active decode blocks.

### Route on Load Only

`--no-router-kv-events` (env `DYN_ROUTER_USE_KV_EVENTS=false`) disables event tracking; the router predicts cache state from its own routing decisions instead of consuming real KV events. Predictions use TTL expiration by default. Experimental `--router-approximate-cache-policy lru` uses each worker data-parallel rank's advertised physical KV capacity and request-lifecycle releases; it is local to one Frontend replica and requires a positive per-rank `total_kv_blocks`. Use approximate mode only when you are not confident the backend emits KV events correctly.

## Swap the Worker-Selection Policy

The knobs above tune Dynamo's built-in cost model. To replace the worker-ranking step entirely, select
one of the built-in worker-selection policies that ship with the Dynamo frontend. This needs
configuration only — no custom image. It applies to this Frontend topology; the standalone EPP in
the [GAIE topology](gateway-api.mdx) links no policy catalog.

Put the policy in a `ConfigMap`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: router-policy
data:
  worker-selection.yaml: |
    worker_selection:
      aggregated: dynamo-two-tier-cost-fn
      instances:
        - name: dynamo-two-tier-cost-fn
          type: dynamo-two-tier-cost-fn
```

Mount it on the Frontend and point `--router-policy-config` at the mounted file:

```yaml
spec:
  components:
  - name: Frontend
    type: frontend
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        volumes:
        - name: router-policy
          configMap:
            name: router-policy
        containers:
        - name: main
          command:
          - python3
          - -m
          - dynamo.frontend
          args:
          - --router-mode
          - kv
          - --router-policy-config
          - /etc/dynamo/router/worker-selection.yaml
          volumeMounts:
          - name: router-policy
            mountPath: /etc/dynamo/router
```

Because the file is startup-only, changing the `ConfigMap` requires a Frontend restart. A policy type
that is not linked into the running image fails startup with the list of linked types rather than
silently falling back, so a typo surfaces in the Frontend logs immediately.

To A/B against the built-in selector, set `DYN_ROUTER_WORKER_SELECTION_POLICY=default` on the Frontend
and restart — the `ConfigMap` stays as it is.

For the available policy types and per-stage prefill/decode selection, see
[Worker-Selection Policies](../../developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/router/configuration-and-tuning.md#worker-selection-policies).

## Routing with Disaggregated Serving

In a disaggregated graph, the router operates over prefill and decode workers separately. The prefill workers publish KV events (the second step above) and the router selects among them; the internal prefill router activates automatically. See [Router with Disaggregated Serving](../../developer-guide/knowledge-base/modular-components/router/disaggregated-serving.md).
