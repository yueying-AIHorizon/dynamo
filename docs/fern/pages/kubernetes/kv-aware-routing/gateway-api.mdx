sidebar-title: Using GAIE with Dynamo
subtitle: Add a Dynamo Endpoint Picker Plugin and HTTPRoute to an existing DynamoGraphDeployment.
---

This how-to places a Kubernetes Gateway in front of an existing `DynamoGraphDeployment` (DGD). The
Gateway API Inference Extension (GAIE) calls the Dynamo Endpoint Picker Plugin (EPP), and the Gateway
forwards each request to the worker selected by the EPP.

Use this topology when Gateway API should own traffic entry, policy, and gateway-level observability.
For direct-to-Frontend routing, use [the Dynamo Frontend](dynamo-frontend.md).

## Before You Begin

You need:

- A working DGD whose workers can serve requests.
- The Dynamo operator installed.
- Gateway API, GAIE, and a compatible Gateway implementation installed. See
  [Install Gateway API Inference Extension](../installation/gateway-api-routing.mdx).
- A `Gateway` named `inference-gateway` in the DGD namespace.

This page modifies an existing DGD named `qwen` that serves `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`. Keep your existing
model credentials, storage, worker images, and backend settings when adapting the example.

<Steps toc={true} tocDepth={2}>

<Step title="Set the deployment variables">

Set the namespace, resource names, model, and local filenames used throughout the procedure:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=my-model
export DYNAMO_VERSION=1.5.0
export DGD_NAME=qwen
export DGD_MANIFEST=qwen-gateway.yaml
export ROUTE_NAME=qwen
export ROUTE_MANIFEST=qwen-gateway-route.yaml
export MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
```

Copy your working DGD manifest to `$DGD_MANIFEST`, then make the changes in the next three steps.

</Step>

<Step title="Add the EPP component">

Add one component with `type: epp` to `qwen-gateway.yaml`. The Dynamo EPP runs the full Dynamo
KV-aware router natively and is configured through `DYN_*` environment variables. Disaggregated
versus aggregated routing is determined automatically from the worker types registered through
Dynamo discovery.

<Warning>
**Go EPP deprecation.** Dynamo no longer ships a Go-based EPP image. New EPP components omit
`eppConfig` and use the native Rust EPP (bundled in the FrontEnd image, first available at
`dynamo-frontend:1.5.0`). Upgrading only the Dynamo Operator does not require EPP migration.
Existing and newly created DGDs may keep the legacy Go EPP Pod contract, but the EPP image must
remain pinned to the 1.4 release line for as long as `eppConfig` remains set. To migrate, remove
`eppConfig` and switch the EPP image to 1.5 or later in one intentional update. Admission rejects
either mixed combination. A DGD allows at most one `type: epp` component, so migration means either
standing up a second DGD or editing the existing one. See
[Migrate from the Go EPP to the Rust EPP](#migrate-from-the-go-epp-to-the-rust-epp) for the
copy-ready procedures, including readiness and rollback checkpoints.
</Warning>

```yaml
spec:
  components:
  - name: Epp
    type: epp
    replicas: 1
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: main
          image: nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/dynamo-frontend:1.5.0
          envFrom:
          - secretRef:
              name: hf-token-secret
          env:
          - name: DYN_MODEL_NAME
            value: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
          - name: DYN_KV_CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE
            value: "16"
```

If your deployment uses another Dynamo version, model, secret name, or backend block size, update
those values in the manifest. For native-Rust EPP deployments, keep the platform, EPP, Frontend
sidecars, and workers on the same Dynamo release line. A legacy DGD is the exception: keep its EPP
image pinned to 1.4 while `eppConfig` remains set. The EPP block size must match the backend block
size.

For a disaggregated graph, start from the repository's
[disaggregated GAIE example](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/examples/backends/vllm/deploy/gaie/disagg.yaml).

</Step>

<Step title="Put worker sidecars in direct mode">

The EPP selects the worker before the request reaches its pod. In each routable worker component, add
a Frontend sidecar and run it in direct mode so it forwards the request without making another worker
selection.

```yaml
spec:
  components:
  - name: worker
    type: decode
    frontendSidecar: sidecar-frontend
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: main
          # Keep the existing worker configuration.
        - name: sidecar-frontend
          image: nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/vllm-runtime:1.5.0
          args:
          - -m
          - dynamo.frontend
          - --router-mode
          - direct
          envFrom:
          - secretRef:
              name: hf-token-secret
```

Keep the existing worker container in the component. If your worker uses another runtime image or
credential source, apply the equivalent values to the sidecar.

</Step>

<Step title="Publish KV cache events">

To route from actual cache contents, enable prefix caching and KV event publication in each routable
worker. For the vLLM worker in `qwen-gateway.yaml`, include settings equivalent to:

```yaml
args:
- >-
  python3 -m dynamo.vllm
  --model $MODEL_PATH
  --enable-prefix-caching
  --block-size 16
  --kv-events-config '{"enable_kv_cache_events":true}'
```

The operator-managed EPP receives these events through the Dynamo event plane. Do not configure a
direct EPP-to-vLLM ZMQ subscription for this topology.

</Step>

<Step title="Apply the updated DGD">

Apply `qwen-gateway.yaml`, wait for the DGD, and inspect the generated `qwen-pool`
`InferencePool`:

```bash
kubectl apply -n "$NAMESPACE" -f "$DGD_MANIFEST"

kubectl wait -n "$NAMESPACE" \
  dynamographdeployment/$DGD_NAME \
  --for=condition=Ready \
  --timeout=1800s

kubectl get inferencepool "${DGD_NAME}-pool" -n "$NAMESPACE"
```

The operator also creates the EPP Deployment and Service.

</Step>

<Step title="Create the HTTPRoute">

Create `qwen-gateway-route.yaml`. The route matches the model header and points to the generated
`qwen-pool` resource:

```bash
cat > "$ROUTE_MANIFEST" <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: ${ROUTE_NAME}
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: inference-gateway
  rules:
  - matches:
    - headers:
      - name: X-Gateway-Model-Name
        type: Exact
        value: ${MODEL_NAME}
      path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    backendRefs:
    - group: inference.networking.k8s.io
      kind: InferencePool
      name: ${DGD_NAME}-pool
      port: 8000
    timeouts:
      request: 300s
EOF

kubectl apply -n "$NAMESPACE" -f "$ROUTE_MANIFEST"
kubectl get httproute "$ROUTE_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE"
```

</Step>

<Step title="Verify the request path">

Port-forward the Service created for the Gateway implementation:

```bash
export GATEWAY_SERVICE=$(kubectl get service -n "$NAMESPACE" \
  -l gateway.networking.k8s.io/gateway-name=inference-gateway \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

kubectl port-forward -n "$NAMESPACE" "service/$GATEWAY_SERVICE" 8000:80
```

In another terminal, restore the variables and send a request through the Gateway:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=my-model
export MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B

curl --max-time 180 -sS http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-Gateway-Model-Name: $MODEL_NAME" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain KV-aware routing."}],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }' | jq .
```

Confirm that the EPP handled endpoint selection:

```bash
kubectl logs -n "$NAMESPACE" \
  -l nvidia.com/dynamo-component-type=epp \
  --tail=200
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Migrate from the Go EPP to the Rust EPP

Dynamo's native Rust EPP is bundled in the FrontEnd image starting at `dynamo-frontend:1.5.0`. If
you have a DGD running the legacy Go EPP (its EPP component sets `eppConfig`), use one of the two
procedures below. A DGD allows at most one `type: epp` component, so "add a Rust EPP alongside the
existing one" is not an option — you either stand up a second DGD or edit the existing one in
place. The two paths have different traffic impact and different rollback boundaries; read both
before you start.

Upgrading only the Dynamo Operator does not require this migration. The 1.5 Operator supports both
existing and newly created legacy DGDs when `eppConfig` remains set and the EPP image remains pinned
to 1.4. Do not update only one side of that pair. Removing `eppConfig` and switching the image to
1.5 or later must be one intentional DGD update.

| | Blue/green (new DGD) | In-place (existing DGD) |
|---|---|---|
| Traffic impact | None until you explicitly patch the route | Rolls the EPP Pod immediately, behind the existing Service |
| Verification | End-to-end canary request through the Gateway before the production route moves | Only possible after the Pod has already rolled |
| Rollback | Patch the route back to the old pool (until the old DGD is deleted) | Re-apply the old `eppConfig` (rolls the Pod a second time) |
| Extra capacity | Runs two full DGDs (workers included) until the old DGD is deleted | None |

Prefer blue/green whenever you can afford a second DGD's worth of capacity for the overlap window.

### Blue/green: bring up a new DGD, verify it, then cut the route over

This keeps the current (Go EPP) DGD serving all traffic, completely unmodified, until a second
(Rust EPP) DGD has been verified end to end through an isolated canary route. The only production
cutover action is a single `HTTPRoute` patch, and that patch can be reverted at any point before the
old DGD is deleted.

**Step 1 — Set variables.** Use separate names for the old and new DGDs; do not reuse `$DGD_NAME`
from the setup steps above.

```bash
export NAMESPACE=my-model
export OLD_DGD_NAME=qwen
export NEW_DGD_NAME=qwen-rust-epp
export OLD_DGD_MANIFEST=qwen-gateway.yaml         # already applied for $OLD_DGD_NAME
export NEW_DGD_MANIFEST=qwen-gateway-rust-epp.yaml
export ROUTE_NAME=qwen
export CANARY_ROUTE_NAME=${ROUTE_NAME}-rust-epp-canary
export CANARY_ROUTE_MANIFEST=qwen-rust-epp-canary-route.yaml
export CANARY_HEADER_VALUE=rust-epp
export MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
export DYNAMO_VERSION=1.5.0                       # first release with the native Rust EPP
```

**Step 2 — Leave the old DGD and its `eppConfig` unchanged.** Do not edit `$OLD_DGD_MANIFEST` and
do not touch its `eppConfig`. Confirm its current state before you start:

```bash
kubectl get dynamographdeployment "$OLD_DGD_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE"
kubectl get inferencepool "${OLD_DGD_NAME}-pool" -n "$NAMESPACE"

kubectl get httproute "$ROUTE_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE" \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.rules[0].backendRefs[0].name}{"\n"}'
```

The last command should print `${OLD_DGD_NAME}-pool`. It stays that way through Step 7.

**Step 3 — Create the new, `eppConfig`-free DGD.** Copy the manifest and apply exactly three
changes: a new name, no `eppConfig` on the EPP component, and a Rust EPP image tag.

```bash
cp "$OLD_DGD_MANIFEST" "$NEW_DGD_MANIFEST"
```

Edit `$NEW_DGD_MANIFEST`:

- Set `metadata.name` to `$NEW_DGD_NAME`.
- On the `type: epp` component, delete the `eppConfig` block entirely — an empty `eppConfig: {}`
  is still legacy-Go-EPP configuration and fails validation, it does not select the Rust EPP.
- Set that component's container image to `nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/dynamo-frontend:${DYNAMO_VERSION}`.

```yaml
spec:
  components:
  - name: Epp
    type: epp
    replicas: 1
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: main
          image: nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/dynamo-frontend:1.5.0
          envFrom:
          - secretRef:
              name: hf-token-secret
          env:
          - name: DYN_MODEL_NAME
            value: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
          - name: DYN_KV_CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE
            value: "16"
```

Keep every other component (workers, sidecars) identical to `$OLD_DGD_NAME` so the two DGDs serve
the same model the same way. This duplicates the worker fleet for the overlap window; only trim
that duplication if you understand you are reducing verification coverage before cutover.

**Step 4 — Apply the new DGD and wait for it, independently of the old one.**

```bash
kubectl apply -n "$NAMESPACE" -f "$NEW_DGD_MANIFEST"

kubectl wait -n "$NAMESPACE" \
  dynamographdeployment/$NEW_DGD_NAME \
  --for=condition=Ready \
  --timeout=1800s
```

**Step 5 — Verify the new DGD, EPP, and InferencePool before the production route moves.**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n "$NAMESPACE" \
  -l nvidia.com/dynamo-graph-deployment-name=$NEW_DGD_NAME,nvidia.com/dynamo-component-type=epp

kubectl get inferencepool "${NEW_DGD_NAME}-pool" -n "$NAMESPACE"

# confirm the route has not moved yet
kubectl get httproute "$ROUTE_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE" \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.rules[0].backendRefs[0].name}{"\n"}'
```

`$NEW_DGD_NAME` produces its own `${NEW_DGD_NAME}-pool` InferencePool — it does not replace or
merge with `${OLD_DGD_NAME}-pool`. The route should still read `${OLD_DGD_NAME}-pool`. This is the
point at which the old DGD remains the only deployment serving production requests.

**Step 6 — Create an isolated canary HTTPRoute to the new InferencePool.** The canary route adds an
exact `X-Dynamo-EPP-Canary` header match. Requests without that header continue to match the
production route and reach the old pool. Requests with both headers match the more specific canary
route and reach only the new pool.

```bash
cat > "$CANARY_ROUTE_MANIFEST" <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: ${CANARY_ROUTE_NAME}
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: inference-gateway
  rules:
  - matches:
    - headers:
      - name: X-Gateway-Model-Name
        type: Exact
        value: ${MODEL_NAME}
      - name: X-Dynamo-EPP-Canary
        type: Exact
        value: ${CANARY_HEADER_VALUE}
      path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    backendRefs:
    - group: inference.networking.k8s.io
      kind: InferencePool
      name: ${NEW_DGD_NAME}-pool
      port: 8000
    timeouts:
      request: 300s
EOF

kubectl apply -n "$NAMESPACE" -f "$CANARY_ROUTE_MANIFEST"
```

Wait until the Gateway accepts the canary route and resolves its InferencePool reference:

```bash
for _ in {1..60}; do
  if kubectl get httproute "$CANARY_ROUTE_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE" -o json \
    | jq -e '
        any(.status.parents[]?;
          any(.conditions[]?; .type == "Accepted" and .status == "True")
          and
          any(.conditions[]?; .type == "ResolvedRefs" and .status == "True")
        )
      ' >/dev/null; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 2
done

kubectl get httproute "$CANARY_ROUTE_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE" -o json \
  | jq -e '
      any(.status.parents[]?;
        any(.conditions[]?; .type == "Accepted" and .status == "True")
        and
        any(.conditions[]?; .type == "ResolvedRefs" and .status == "True")
      )
    '
```

The final command must print `true`. Do not continue if either condition is missing or false.

**Step 7 — Send a real request through the canary route before production cutover.** Reuse the
port-forward from [Verify the request path](#verify-the-request-path), add the canary header, and
confirm the new EPP handled the request:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body --max-time 180 -sS http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-Gateway-Model-Name: $MODEL_NAME" \
  -H "X-Dynamo-EPP-Canary: $CANARY_HEADER_VALUE" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain KV-aware routing."}],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }' | jq -e '.choices | length > 0'

kubectl logs -n "$NAMESPACE" \
  -l nvidia.com/dynamo-graph-deployment-name=$NEW_DGD_NAME,nvidia.com/dynamo-component-type=epp \
  --tail=200
```

Do not proceed until the request succeeds and the logs confirm the new EPP performed endpoint
selection. The production route still points to `${OLD_DGD_NAME}-pool`.

**Step 8 — Patch the production HTTPRoute from `${OLD_DGD_NAME}-pool` to
`${NEW_DGD_NAME}-pool`.** This is the production traffic cutover:

```bash
kubectl patch httproute "$ROUTE_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE" --type='json' -p='[
  {"op":"replace","path":"/spec/rules/0/backendRefs/0/name","value":"'"${NEW_DGD_NAME}"'-pool"}
]'

kubectl get httproute "$ROUTE_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE" \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.rules[0].backendRefs[0].name}{"\n"}'
```

Confirm the last command prints `${NEW_DGD_NAME}-pool`.

**Step 9 — Verify the production route and remove the canary route.** Send the same request without
the canary header:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body --max-time 180 -sS http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-Gateway-Model-Name: $MODEL_NAME" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain KV-aware routing."}],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }' | jq -e '.choices | length > 0'
```

The command must print `true`. If it fails, immediately apply the rollback patch below instead of
deleting the canary route or changing the old DGD. After it succeeds, remove the canary route:

```bash
kubectl delete httproute "$CANARY_ROUTE_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE"
```

**Step 10 — Keep the old DGD unchanged for the rollback window, then delete it.** Retaining the old
DGD at its original replica counts keeps its pool ready for an immediate route rollback. Do not
apply a blanket scale-to-zero patch: the legacy EPP must remain at one replica, and components with
`scalingAdapter` may be owned by an HPA, KEDA, or Planner autoscaler instead of the DGD.

```bash
kubectl get dynamographdeployment "$OLD_DGD_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE"

# After the rollback window ends:
kubectl delete dynamographdeployment "$OLD_DGD_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE"
```

#### Rollback (blue/green)

- **Before `$OLD_DGD_NAME` is deleted:** it remains at its original replica counts. Roll back with
  the same route patch, reversed:

  ```bash
  kubectl patch httproute "$ROUTE_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE" --type='json' -p='[
    {"op":"replace","path":"/spec/rules/0/backendRefs/0/name","value":"'"${OLD_DGD_NAME}"'-pool"}
  ]'

  kubectl delete httproute "$CANARY_ROUTE_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE" --ignore-not-found
  ```

- **After `$OLD_DGD_NAME` is deleted:** there is no pool left to patch back to. Rollback means
  re-applying the retained old DGD manifest from source control, waiting for it to become Ready,
  and only then repeating the route patch. Treat deletion as the point of no quick return.

### In-place: clear `eppConfig` on the live DGD

Use this only when you cannot afford a second DGD's worth of capacity. It reuses the same DGD,
Service (`${DGD_NAME}-epp`), and InferencePool (`${DGD_NAME}-pool`) names, so there is no second
pool to stage traffic on and no dual-serving window: clearing `eppConfig` immediately rolls the EPP
Pod through a standard Kubernetes Deployment rolling update behind the existing Service.

```bash
export NAMESPACE=my-model
export DGD_NAME=qwen
export DGD_MANIFEST=qwen-gateway.yaml
export DYNAMO_VERSION=1.5.0
```

1. Edit `$DGD_MANIFEST`: remove the `eppConfig` block from the `type: epp` component and set its
   image to `nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/dynamo-frontend:${DYNAMO_VERSION}`.
2. Apply it. This is the moment the EPP Pod rolls — there is no readiness gate before it, unlike
   the blue/green path:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -n "$NAMESPACE" -f "$DGD_MANIFEST"
   kubectl rollout status deployment/${DGD_NAME}-epp -n "$NAMESPACE"
   ```

3. Send a request per [Verify the request path](#verify-the-request-path) and confirm the EPP logs
   show the Rust EPP handling selection.

**Rollback boundary is different from blue/green.** There is no second pool or route to patch.
Rolling back means re-editing `$DGD_MANIFEST` to restore the previous `eppConfig` block and Go EPP
image tag, then re-applying it — which rolls the same Pod a second time. Because old and new EPP
Pods share one Service during the rollout, rolling back does not undo any requests that were
already routed to a Pod running the new EPP.

## Troubleshoot the Route

If the request does not reach a worker, set the resource variables and inspect the request path in
order:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=my-model
export DGD_NAME=qwen
export ROUTE_NAME=qwen

kubectl describe gateway inference-gateway -n "$NAMESPACE"
kubectl describe httproute "$ROUTE_NAME" -n "$NAMESPACE"
kubectl describe inferencepool "${DGD_NAME}-pool" -n "$NAMESPACE"
kubectl get pods -n "$NAMESPACE" -l nvidia.com/dynamo-component-type=epp
```

- If the DGD is rejected because the `InferencePool` API is unavailable, install GAIE before applying
  a DGD with an EPP component.
- If the Gateway returns HTTP 500 in an Istio-injected namespace, verify that the Gateway proxy does
  not have an `istio-proxy` sidecar. See
  [agentgateway and Istio injection](../../reference/components/gateway-api-routing.mdx#agentgateway-and-istio-injection).
- If routing ignores expected prefix overlap, verify that workers publish KV events and that
  `DYN_KV_CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE` matches the backend block size.

For resource fields, runtime settings, request headers, and service-mesh behavior, see the
[Gateway API Routing Reference](../../reference/components/gateway-api-routing.mdx).
