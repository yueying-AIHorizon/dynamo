## What Are LoRA Adapters

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) serves specialized model variants without duplicating full base weights. Dynamo supports dynamic LoRA lifecycle management with vLLM and SGLang, with different validation levels for each backend. It provides:

- **Dynamic loading**: Load and unload adapters without restarting workers
- **Multiple sources**: `file://`, `s3://`, or `hf://` URIs
- **Automatic caching**: Downloaded adapters are cached under `DYN_LORA_PATH`
- **Discovery**: Loaded adapters appear in `/v1/models`
- **KV-aware routing**: Route requests to workers with the matching adapter and cached prefix blocks; validated with vLLM
- **Kubernetes native**: Manage adapters declaratively through the `DynamoModel` CRD; documented for vLLM

## Backend Support

| Backend | Status | Support Scope |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| vLLM | <Badge intent="success" minimal>Supported</Badge> | Dynamic load/unload for aggregated and disaggregated workers; aggregated adapter-aware KV routing |
| SGLang | <Badge intent="warning" minimal>Experimental</Badge> | Dynamic load/unload and aggregated inference; disaggregated serving and feature pairings are not end-to-end validated |
| TensorRT-LLM | <Badge intent="note" minimal>Not supported</Badge> | — |

See the [feature support matrix](../../reference/general/compatibility.mdx#feature-support) for the backend and interaction matrices.

## Serve a LoRA Adapter

The following Kubernetes and local workflows use vLLM. For the aggregated SGLang workflow, see [Serve a LoRA Adapter with SGLang](#serve-a-lora-adapter-with-sglang).

> [!WARNING]
> Keep `DYN_SYSTEM_PORT` on a trusted administrative network. The system API retrieves and loads model artifacts from configured URI sources; do not expose it to untrusted clients.

<Tab title="Kubernetes">

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    - A Kubernetes cluster with the Dynamo Platform installed and a vLLM runtime image
    - A LoRA adapter compatible with your base model
    - For `s3://` sources: AWS credentials in a Kubernetes Secret

    Full manifests and MinIO setup: [Kubernetes LoRA deployment example](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/main/examples/backends/vllm/deploy/lora).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy a LoRA-enabled worker">
    Enable LoRA on the **worker**: set LoRA and system API environment variables, and pass vLLM LoRA flags in `args:`. `DYN_SYSTEM_ENABLED` and `DYN_SYSTEM_PORT` expose load/unload on the worker system port.

    Adapted from the [`agg_lora.yaml` example](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/examples/backends/vllm/deploy/lora/agg_lora.yaml):

    kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready dynamographdeployment/vllm-agg-lora \
      -n ${NAMESPACE} --timeout=600s
    ```

    **Worker environment variables**

    | Variable | Description | Default |
    |----------|-------------|---------|
    | `DYN_LORA_ENABLED` | Enable LoRA adapter support | `false` |
    | `DYN_LORA_PATH` | Local cache directory for downloaded LoRAs | `~/.cache/dynamo_loras` |
    | `DYN_SYSTEM_ENABLED` | Expose worker load/unload API | `false` |
    | `DYN_SYSTEM_PORT` | System API port | — |
    | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | S3 access key from the environment credential provider | — |
    | `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | S3 secret key from the environment credential provider | — |
    | `AWS_PROFILE` | Shared AWS configuration and credentials profile | `default` |
    | `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` | Shared credentials file path | `~/.aws/credentials` |
    | `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` | Shared configuration file path | `~/.aws/config` |
    | `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3` | Service-specific custom S3 endpoint | — |
    | `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` | Generic custom AWS endpoint | — |
    | `AWS_ENDPOINT` | Legacy custom S3 endpoint fallback | — |
    | `AWS_REGION` | AWS region | `us-east-1` |
    | `AWS_ALLOW_HTTP` | Allow HTTP (non-TLS) connections | `false` |
    | `AWS_VIRTUAL_HOSTED_STYLE_REQUEST` | Use bucket-qualified virtual-hosted requests | `false` |

    For `s3://` sources, Dynamo uses the standard AWS credential provider chain, including environment variables, shared configuration and credentials files, web identity, container credentials, and Amazon EC2 instance metadata. Endpoint precedence is `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`, the active profile's S3 service endpoint, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, the active profile's generic `endpoint_url`, then the legacy `AWS_ENDPOINT` fallback.

    **vLLM worker arguments**

    | Argument | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `--enable-lora` | Enable LoRA adapter support in vLLM |
    | `--max-lora-rank` | Maximum LoRA rank (must be >= your adapter's rank) |
    | `--max-loras` | Maximum number of LoRAs loaded simultaneously |

    > [!WARNING]
    > Set `--max-lora-rank` to at least your adapter's rank. A lower value causes load failures.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="S3 or MinIO credentials on the worker">
        Mount shared AWS files and set `AWS_PROFILE`, or store environment credentials in a Kubernetes Secret. Set non-secret endpoint and region values inline:

  <Step title="Load an adapter">
    Use a `DynamoModel` CRD for declarative, cluster-native loading. It discovers worker endpoints for `baseModelName`, creates a Service, and calls the load API on each pod.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: nvidia.com/v1alpha1
    kind: DynamoModel
    metadata:
      name: customer-support-lora
      namespace: dynamo-system
    spec:
      modelName: customer-support-adapter-v1
      baseModelName: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B  # Must match the worker --model value
      modelType: lora
      source:
        uri: s3://my-models-bucket/loras/customer-support/v1
    ```

    Verify readiness:

    ```bash
    kubectl get dynamomodel customer-support-lora
    # NAME                    TOTAL   READY   AGE
    # customer-support-lora   2       2       30s
    ```

    See the [DynamoModel API reference](../../reference/kubernetes-api/full-api-reference.mdx#dynamomodel) for the CRD fields.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Load imperatively with the worker system API">
        Port-forward the worker system port and POST to `/v1/loras`:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    - Dynamo with the vLLM backend installed and a CUDA GPU
    - A LoRA adapter compatible with your base model

    For S3-compatible local storage, run the MinIO setup script first:

    ```bash
    cd examples/backends/vllm/launch/lora
    ./setup_minio.sh
    ```

    See the [local LoRA example](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/main/examples/backends/vllm/launch/lora) for the full workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy a LoRA-enabled worker">
    Launch the frontend and a LoRA-enabled vLLM worker:

    ```bash
    cd examples/backends/vllm/launch/lora
    ./agg_lora.sh
    ```

    The script sets `DYN_LORA_ENABLED`, `DYN_LORA_PATH`, MinIO credentials, and starts `dynamo.frontend` plus `dynamo.vllm` with `--enable-lora` and `--max-lora-rank 64`. Override the base model with the `MODEL` environment variable.

    To run the commands manually instead:

    ```bash
    export DYN_LORA_ENABLED=true
    export DYN_LORA_PATH=/tmp/dynamo_loras
    export DYN_SYSTEM_ENABLED=true
    export DYN_SYSTEM_PORT=8081

    python -m dynamo.vllm --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
      --enable-lora --max-lora-rank 64 --enforce-eager
    ```

    Set `AWS_*` variables when loading from `s3://` URIs (the launch script configures MinIO defaults).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Load an adapter">
    POST to the worker system API on `DYN_SYSTEM_PORT` (default `8081` in `agg_lora.sh`):

    Use `file:///path/to/my-lora` for local adapters. List loaded adapters with `GET /v1/loras`. Unload with `DELETE /v1/loras/{lora_name}`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run inference">

## Serve a LoRA Adapter with SGLang

**Experimental.** The repository validates dynamic loading, discovery, and inference for aggregated SGLang workers. Unloading is implemented but not exercised by an end-to-end test. Prefill and decode lifecycle registration has unit coverage, but disaggregated SGLang LoRA and feature pairings such as KV-aware routing are not end-to-end validated. The Kubernetes workflow above and the adapter-aware routing demo below are vLLM-specific.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the adapter">
    Start MinIO and upload the example adapter:

    ```bash
    cd examples/backends/sglang/launch/lora
    ./setup_minio.sh
    ```

    See the [SGLang LoRA example](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/main/examples/backends/sglang/launch/lora) for the scripts and configurable environment variables.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch aggregated serving">
    Start the Dynamo frontend and a LoRA-enabled SGLang worker:

    ```bash
    ./agg_lora.sh
    ```

    The script starts `dynamo.sglang` with `--enable-lora`, `--max-lora-rank 64`, and `--lora-target-modules all`. It also sets `DYN_LORA_ENABLED`, `DYN_LORA_PATH`, and the worker system port.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Load and query the adapter">
    Load the adapter through the worker system API, then address it by name in the OpenAI-compatible request:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1/loras \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "lora_name": "codelion/Qwen3-0.6B-accuracy-recovery-lora",
        "source": {
          "uri": "s3://my-loras/codelion/Qwen3-0.6B-accuracy-recovery-lora"
        }
      }'
    ```

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "codelion/Qwen3-0.6B-accuracy-recovery-lora",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is deep learning?"}],
        "max_tokens": 100
      }'
    ```

    List loaded adapters with `GET /v1/loras`. Unload with `DELETE /v1/loras/{lora_name}`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## KV Cache-Aware LoRA Routing

This section describes the validated vLLM path. KV-aware routing with SGLang LoRA remains experimental because the combined path is not end-to-end validated.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How LoRA-aware KV routing works">
    When KV-aware routing is enabled, the router accounts for LoRA adapter identity when computing block hashes:

    - **Distinct hash spaces per adapter**: Blocks cached under adapter `A` are never confused with adapter `B` or the base model, even when token sequences match. The adapter name is mixed into the `LocalBlockHash` computation.
    - **Prefix sharing within the same adapter**: Requests targeting the same LoRA adapter reuse KV prefix blocks like base-model requests.
    - **No extra configuration**: The LoRA name propagates through KV events (`BlockStored`) from the engine to the router. The router uses the `lora_name` field to route requests to workers with matching cached blocks.

    This works across the publisher pipeline, the KV consolidator, and the routing query path.

    For a local two-worker demo with KV-aware routing, run [`agg_lora_router.sh`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/examples/backends/vllm/launch/lora/agg_lora_router.sh) and load the adapter on both worker system ports.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="LoRA fails to load">
    **Check S3 connectivity:**

    ```bash
    aws s3 ls s3://my-loras/ --recursive
    ```

    **Check the cache directory:**

    ```bash
    ls -la ~/.cache/dynamo_loras/
    # or the path set in DYN_LORA_PATH
    ```

    **Check worker logs:**

    ```bash
    kubectl logs deployment/my-worker | grep -i lora
    ```

    Confirm `--max-lora-rank` is at least your adapter's rank.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model not found after loading">
    - Verify the LoRA name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
    - List loaded adapters: `curl http://localhost:9090/v1/loras` (port-forward the worker's `DYN_SYSTEM_PORT` first on Kubernetes)
    - Check worker logs for discovery registration errors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inference returns the base model response">
    - Confirm the request `model` field matches the loaded `lora_name`
    - Verify the adapter is loaded on the worker handling the request
    - For vLLM disaggregated serving, load the adapter on both prefill and decode workers
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
