title: Benchmark a Local Deployment with AIPerf
subtitle: Measure latency and throughput through the local Dynamo frontend
---

AIPerf sends load to an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and measures latency and throughput. Use this
tutorial after starting a local Dynamo frontend and at least one model worker.

AIPerf measures the live deployment. It does not predict a configuration like AIConfigurator or run
a GPU-free simulation like Mocker and DynoSim.

<Note title="Using an AI coding agent?">
This repository ships agent skills for performance work: clone the repo, point Claude Code,
Codex, or Cursor at it, and describe your deployment and goal in plain language. The skills
activate automatically and guide the agent through deploying, benchmarking with AIPerf, and
iterating on configuration with evidence at every step. See
[Agent Skills](../../agent-skills/overview.mdx) for the inventory and example prompts.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Start a local deployment by following [Model Deployment](../model-deployment/introduction.mdx). Confirm that the frontend is
available at `http://localhost:8000`:

```bash
curl --fail http://localhost:8000/health
```

Install AIPerf on the machine that will generate load:

```bash
pip install aiperf
```

<Steps toc={true}>
<Step title="Run a baseline benchmark" id="run-a-baseline-benchmark">
Set the model name to the value served by the local worker:

```bash
aiperf profile \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-32B-FP8 \
  --url http://localhost:8000 \
  --endpoint-type chat \
  --streaming \
  --concurrency 10 \
  --request-count 100 \
  --synthetic-input-tokens-mean 2000 \
  --output-tokens-mean 256
```

AIPerf writes artifacts to `artifacts/` and prints a metrics summary. Record TTFT, Inter-Token
Latency (ITL), end-to-end latency, and output throughput.

</Step>
<Step title="Compare local configurations" id="compare-local-configurations">
Change one deployment setting at a time, restart the affected workers, and rerun the same AIPerf
command. Common comparisons include:

- one worker versus multiple replicas
- aggregated versus disaggregated serving
- KV-aware routing versus round-robin routing
- different TP or PP sizes recommended by AIConfigurator
- backend or engine-argument changes

Keep the request shape, concurrency, and request count fixed so that the results remain comparable.
Then sweep concurrency to find the saturation point of the selected configuration.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

- Use [Sizing with AIConfigurator](../disaggregated-serving/sizing-with-aiconfigurator.mdx) to select additional configurations.
- Use the full [Dynamo Benchmarking guide](../../recipes/feature-benchmarks/benchmarking-guide.md) for concurrency sweeps,
  arrival patterns, trace replay, visualization, and GPU telemetry.
