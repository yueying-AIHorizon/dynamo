title: Observe a Local Deployment
subtitle: Inspect metrics, traces, logs, request captures, scheduler telemetry, and process health
---

Use the stack from [Install Observability](../installation/observability.mdx) to inspect a local Dynamo
deployment. This guide covers the common operational workflows; configuration fields and signal
internals live in Reference and Design Documents.

## View Metrics and Dashboards

<Steps toc={true}>
<Step title="Start the frontend" id="start-the-frontend">

Start the frontend on port `8000`:

```bash
python -m dynamo.frontend
```

</Step>
<Step title="Start a worker" id="start-a-worker">

In another terminal, start a vLLM worker and expose its system metrics on port `8081`:

```bash
DYN_SYSTEM_PORT=8081 python -m dynamo.vllm \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --enforce-eager
```

The supplied Prometheus configuration scrapes the frontend at `host.docker.internal:8000` and
workers at `host.docker.internal:8081` and `host.docker.internal:8082`.

</Step>
<Step title="Generate traffic" id="generate-metrics">

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "max_completion_tokens": 100
  }'
```

</Step>
<Step title="Inspect the metrics" id="inspect-metrics">

Check the frontend at `http://localhost:8000/metrics` and the worker at
`http://localhost:8081/metrics`. Then open Grafana at `http://localhost:3000`, sign in with username
`dynamo` and password `dynamo`, and open **Dashboards > Dynamo Dashboard**.

Prometheus registers labeled series after the first matching request, so some metric families remain
empty until the deployment serves traffic.

</Step>
</Steps>

For metric definitions and labels, see the [Metrics Catalog](../../reference/observability/metrics-catalog.mdx)
and [Metric Labels](../../reference/observability/metric-labels.mdx).

## Inspect Traces and Exported Logs

Dynamo exports traces and logs together when OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) export is enabled. The
local OpenTelemetry Collector sends traces to Tempo and logs to Loki.

<Steps toc={true}>
<Step title="Launch a traced deployment" id="launch-a-traced-deployment">

Run the aggregated vLLM tracing example:

```bash
cd examples/backends/vllm/launch
./agg_tracing.sh
```

For a two-GPU prefill/decode deployment, use `./disagg_tracing.sh` instead. The scripts enable JSONL
logging and OTLP export over gRPC and assign service names to the Dynamo processes.

</Step>
<Step title="Send an identifiable request" id="send-an-identifiable-request">

Use the model name printed by the launch script. Add `x-request-id` to correlate the request across
traces and logs:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-request-id: test-trace-001' \
  -d '{
    "model": "<MODEL>",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}],
    "max_completion_tokens": 100
  }'
```

</Step>
<Step title="Find the trace" id="find-the-trace">

In Grafana, open **Explore**, select **Tempo**, and use **Search**. Filter by a service name such as
`dynamo-frontend`, a span name such as `http-request`, or the request attribute
`x_request_id=test-trace-001`.

</Step>
<Step title="Find the logs" id="find-the-logs">

In **Explore**, select **Loki** and search for the same `x_request_id` or `trace_id`. The provisioned
Loki data source links trace IDs back to Tempo.

</Step>
</Steps>

To configure export endpoints, sampling, service names, or logging levels, see
[Environment Variables](../../reference/observability/environment-variables.mdx). For log formats and
fields, see [Logging Reference](../../reference/observability/logging.mdx). For the signal pipeline and
span relationships, see [Observability Architecture](../../developer-guide/knowledge-base/concepts/observability-architecture.md).


## Capture Forward Pass Metrics

Forward Pass Metrics (FPM) tracing records backend scheduler telemetry to rotating gzip JSONL files.
It is a best-effort observability stream: Dynamo continues publishing FPM events to the event plane
while writing a local copy for analysis.

<Warning>
FPM trace files can contain detailed workload-shape information. Store them according to your
organization's telemetry retention and access policies.
</Warning>

<Steps toc={true}>
<Step title="Choose a trace path" id="choose-fpm-trace-path">

Set a writable output prefix. The default, `/tmp/dynamo-fpm`, is suitable for temporary local
analysis:

```bash
export DYN_FPM_OUTPUT_PATH=/tmp/dynamo-fpm
```

Each worker writes a producer-specific sequence such as
`/tmp/dynamo-fpm.4192.000000.jsonl.gz`.

</Step>
<Step title="Start a worker with FPM tracing" id="start-fpm-tracing">

Use the worker CLI switch:

```bash
python -m dynamo.vllm \
  --fpm-trace \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
```

Or set `DYN_FPM_TRACE=1` before starting a supported worker. The default `sampled` mode keeps the
latest changed record per worker and data-parallel rank every five seconds. To capture every valid
payload, including idle heartbeats, set `DYN_FPM_MODE=full`; full mode can generate substantially
more I/O.

</Step>
<Step title="Inspect the trace" id="inspect-fpm-trace">

Generate representative traffic, list the segments, and decompress one producer's files in index
order:

```bash
ls -1 /tmp/dynamo-fpm.*.jsonl.gz
gzip -cd /tmp/dynamo-fpm.4192.*.jsonl.gz | jq -c '.event'
```

Replace `4192` with the producer ID in the file name. Use `worker_id`, `dp_rank`, and `counter_id`
together when checking continuity. Gaps can result from sampling, queue pressure, transport loss, or
worker termination.

</Step>
</Steps>

behavior, see [Forward Pass Metrics Trace Reference](../../reference/observability/forward-pass-metrics-traces.mdx).

[Observability Architecture](../../developer-guide/knowledge-base/concepts/observability-architecture.md#forward-pass-metrics-persistence).

## Capture and Replay Requests

Request tracing records replay metadata for eligible OpenAI chat and completion requests. It can
also capture chat request and response payloads and export records through the OpenTelemetry Protocol
(OTLP) log pipeline.

<Warning>
Request payloads and captured HTTP headers can contain sensitive data. Restrict access to trace
sinks and do not allowlist credential-bearing headers.
</Warning>

### Capture Replay Metadata

Enable the default rotating gzip file sink before starting the frontend:

```bash
export DYN_REQUEST_TRACE=1
export DYN_REQUEST_TRACE_FILE_PATH=/tmp/dynamo-request-trace
```

After sending representative traffic, confirm that Dynamo writes segments such as
`/tmp/dynamo-request-trace.000000.jsonl.gz`. The default record selection is `request_end,tool`.
Session headers enrich supported rows with session identity and dependencies; they do not enable
sticky routing.

### Capture Request and Response Payloads

Select the payload record and one or more sinks:

```bash
export DYN_REQUEST_TRACE_RECORDS=request_payload
export DYN_REQUEST_TRACE_SINKS=file
export DYN_REQUEST_TRACE_FILE_PATH=/tmp/dynamo-request-payloads
```

To retain replay metadata and payloads in one stream, set
`DYN_REQUEST_TRACE_RECORDS=request_end,request_payload,tool`. Canceled and failed chat requests
retain the request body and omit the response body.

To capture selected request headers, provide a comma- or whitespace-separated allowlist:

```bash
export DYN_REQUEST_TRACE_HTTP_HEADER_CAPTURE_LIST='x-request-id,x-tenant-id'
```

Header matching is case-insensitive. Dynamo does not redact captured values.

### Export Payloads over OTLP

Include the `otel` sink and configure the logs endpoint and protocol:

```bash
export DYN_REQUEST_TRACE_RECORDS=request_payload
export DYN_REQUEST_TRACE_SINKS=otel
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_PROTOCOL=grpc
```

Use `file,otel` to retain a local copy. Setting an OTLP logs endpoint without including `otel` does
not export request trace records. In Grafana, query Loki for scope `dynamo.request_trace` or body
`request_payload`.

### Replay a Capture

Save `/tmp/request-trace-prediction.yaml` with the `dynamo.request.trace.v1` JSONL or JSONL.GZ
shards:

```yaml
traffic:
  source:
    type: trace
    format: dynamo
    paths: [/tmp/dynamo-request-trace.0000.jsonl.gz]
  load: {type: trace_timestamps, speedup: 1.0}
engine:
  mode: aggregated
  model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  hardware: h200_sxm
  backend: vllm
  context_length: max
  workers:
    aggregated:
      parallelism: {replicas: 4, tensor: 1, pipeline: 1, attention_data: 1, moe_tensor: 1, moe_expert: 1}
      scheduler: {max_batched_tokens: 8192, max_sequences: 256}
      kv_cache: {block_size: 64, prefix_caching: true, capacity: {type: default, memory_fraction: 0.9}}
      timing: {type: default}
router:
  policy: kv_router
  prefill_load_model: {type: none}
planner: {policy: disabled}
```

Add every shard to `traffic.source.paths`, then run the offline prediction:

```bash
aisimulate predict \
  --stack dynamo \
  --config /tmp/request-trace-prediction.yaml \
  --output-dir /tmp/request-trace-prediction
```

No Mooncake conversion is required. AISimulate derives and validates the trace block size. It preserves
session dependencies and tool waits when every request has session context and rejects mixed
session-aware and context-free trace sets.

For all variables, compatibility aliases, sinks, record schemas, and supported request shapes, see
[Request Trace Reference](../../reference/observability/request-traces.mdx).

## Check Deployment Health

Use Dynamo's HTTP health endpoints to check local processes or configure an external supervisor. The
frontend serves its endpoints on the HTTP port. Workers and standalone routers serve health endpoints
through the system-status server when `DYN_SYSTEM_PORT` is enabled.

<Steps toc={true}>
<Step title="Start Dynamo components" id="start-health-components">

```bash
python -m dynamo.frontend &
DYN_SYSTEM_PORT=8081 python -m dynamo.vllm \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --enforce-eager &
```

</Step>
<Step title="Check the frontend" id="check-frontend-health">

```bash
curl --silent --show-error http://localhost:8000/live | jq
curl --silent --show-error http://localhost:8000/health | jq
```

`/live` reports whether the HTTP service is running. `/health` reports frontend readiness and the
worker endpoints and instances currently visible through discovery.

</Step>
<Step title="Check a worker" id="check-worker-health">

```bash
curl --silent --show-error http://localhost:8081/live | jq
curl --silent --show-error http://localhost:8081/health | jq
```

A worker returns `503 Service Unavailable` while its status is `notready` and `200 OK` after it
becomes `ready`.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Enable Active Worker Checks

Canary checks send a small inference request through an idle worker endpoint. Enable them when you
need active failure detection:

```bash
export DYN_HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED=true
export DYN_CANARY_WAIT_TIME=10
export DYN_HEALTH_CHECK_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=3

DYN_SYSTEM_PORT=8081 python -m dynamo.vllm \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --enforce-eager
```

Normal successful traffic resets the idle timer. After the configured idle period, Dynamo sends a
canary request; a timeout marks the endpoint unhealthy.

### Troubleshoot Health Checks

- **Connection refused:** Set `DYN_SYSTEM_PORT` before starting a worker and query that port.
- **Worker remains `notready`:** Inspect startup logs and confirm the engine registered its serving
  endpoint.
- **Canary checks do not run:** Confirm `DYN_HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED=true` was set before startup.
- **Canary checks time out:** Inspect engine errors and increase `DYN_HEALTH_CHECK_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`
  only when normal inference latency requires it.

For response fields, status codes, custom paths, active-check defaults, and endpoint differences, see
[Health Check Reference](../../reference/observability/health-checks.mdx). For the canary lifecycle, see
[Observability Architecture](../../developer-guide/knowledge-base/concepts/observability-architecture.md#active-worker-health-checks).

## Troubleshoot Collection

- **Prometheus target is down:** Open `http://localhost:9090/targets`, confirm the process uses the
  configured port, and confirm it is reachable through `host.docker.internal`.
- **Tempo or Loki is empty:** Set `OTEL_EXPORT_ENABLED=true` on every process. For gRPC, use the Collector endpoint `http://localhost:4317`. For HTTP/protobuf, set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf` and use the Collector HTTP endpoint. Logs do not fall back to the traces-only endpoint.
- **Only some components appear:** Environment variables are process-local. Export the OTLP and
  logging variables before starting the frontend, router, and each worker.
- **Stack service is unhealthy:** Run `docker compose -f dev/docker-observability.yml ps` and inspect
  the relevant service with `docker compose -f dev/docker-observability.yml logs <service>`.

Service ports, configuration files, and optional profiles are listed in the
[Local Observability Stack Reference](../../reference/observability/local-stack.mdx).
