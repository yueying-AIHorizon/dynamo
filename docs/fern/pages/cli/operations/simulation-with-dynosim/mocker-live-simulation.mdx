title: Simulate a Local Deployment with Mocker
subtitle: Run a GPU-free frontend and simulated worker from the command line
---

Mocker is a simulated Dynamo backend. Use it locally to test frontend discovery, routing, KV events,
and worker behavior without loading a model or using GPUs. This is a **live simulation**: you start a
frontend and workers, then send HTTP requests through the Dynamo runtime.

For a faster **offline replay** that drives simulated engines directly without a frontend, worker
registration, or runtime services, see [Run a DynoSim Simulation](dynosim-replay.mdx).

This tutorial uses file-based discovery so that the frontend and worker can run without etcd or
NATS. For Kubernetes, see
[Simulate a Kubernetes Deployment](../../../kubernetes/operations/simulation-with-dynosim/mocker-live-simulation.mdx).
For commonly used flags, see the
[Mocker CLI Reference](../../../reference/components/mocker-cli-reference.mdx).

## Prerequisites

Install Dynamo by following [Install Dynamo](../../installation/install-dynamo.mdx). Verify that
the local environment can import the frontend and Mocker modules:

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.frontend --help >/dev/null
python3 -m dynamo.mocker --help >/dev/null
```

<Steps toc={true}>
<Step title="Start the frontend" id="start-the-frontend">
In the first terminal, start the OpenAI-compatible frontend:

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000 --discovery-backend file
```

File-based discovery keeps this tutorial on one machine and selects the local event path.

</Step>
<Step title="Start a Mocker worker" id="start-a-mocker-worker">
In a second terminal, start one simulated worker with the same discovery backend:

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.mocker \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --discovery-backend file
```

Wait for the worker to register with the frontend.

</Step>
<Step title="Send a request" id="send-a-request">
In a third terminal, send a request to the frontend:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "max_tokens": 32
  }'
```

A successful response confirms that local discovery and request routing are working.

</Step>
<Step title="Run multiple simulated workers" id="run-multiple-simulated-workers">
Stop the Mocker process and restart it with four workers:

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.mocker \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --discovery-backend file \
  --num-workers 4
```

Send several requests and compare the frontend and worker logs. For local scale tests, prefer
`--num-workers` over launching many separate Mocker processes because the workers share one runtime
and thread pool.

</Step>
<Step title="Simulate disaggregated serving" id="simulate-disaggregated-serving">
Stop the aggregated Mocker process. Start a prefill worker:

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.mocker \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --discovery-backend file \
  --disaggregation-mode prefill \
  --bootstrap-ports 50100
```

In another terminal, start a decode worker:

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.mocker \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --discovery-backend file \
  --disaggregation-mode decode
```

Send another request and inspect both worker logs to confirm that the request moved through prefill
and decode.

</Step>
<Step title="Tune the simulation" id="tune-the-simulation">
Restart the worker with settings that match the experiment you want to run. For example:

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.mocker \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --discovery-backend file \
  --num-gpu-blocks-override 8192 \
  --block-size 64 \
  --max-num-seqs 256 \
  --speedup-ratio 10.0
```

Use the [Mocker CLI Reference](../../../reference/components/mocker-cli-reference.mdx) for scheduling,
KV-cache, timing, AIC, and transport settings. Use [Run a DynoSim Simulation](dynosim-replay.mdx) when you want
to replay a complete trace without managing live frontend and worker processes.
