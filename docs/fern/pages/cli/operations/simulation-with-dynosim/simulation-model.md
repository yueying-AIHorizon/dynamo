title: DynoSim Simulation Model
subtitle: Engine behavior, timing sources, KV movement, and fidelity boundaries
---

DynoSim builds a distributed serving simulation from Mocker engine cores. Each core owns
engine-specific scheduler and KV-cache state. Offline prediction and live Mocker workers drive the
same core through virtual-time and wall-clock execution, respectively.

Run `python3 -m dynamo.mocker` to launch live workers. This worker launcher is separate from the
former public Replay online CLI, which remains unavailable in the unified AISimulate CLI. The
Python replay SDK retains online mode for programmatic callers.

## Engine Behavior

Mocker exposes three engine modes through two scheduler cores. The TensorRT-LLM mode uses the
vLLM-shaped core with a different capacity policy.

| Behavior | vLLM | SGLang | TensorRT-LLM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scheduler model | Waiting and running queues with a shared token budget | Cache-aware waiting and running queues | vLLM-shaped core with capacity-first admission |
| KV representation | Native block pool | Token pool and radix cache | Native block pool |
| Memory pressure | LIFO or FIFO recompute preemption | Decode retraction with cached-prefix preservation | `GUARANTEED_NO_EVICT`; reserves prompt plus maximum output at admission |
| Prefix reuse | Block-hash matching when prefix caching is enabled | Radix-prefix matching | Block-hash matching when prefix caching is enabled |
| Default block or page size | 64 tokens | 1 token, or `sglang.page_size` | 32 tokens |
| Aggregated simulation | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Prefill/decode disaggregation | Supported | Supported | Not supported |

Data-parallel ranks own independent scheduler and KV-pool state. The internal worker runtime and
offline prediction compose those ranks into one logical worker with a shared pass barrier.

### KV Managers

The shared vLLM/TensorRT-LLM core uses Mocker's self-contained physical block pool to model GPU KV
capacity, prefix reuse, request ownership, least-recently-used eviction, and router-visible KV
events. The SGLang core uses its own token-pool and radix-cache implementation.

## Timing Sources

Scheduler state determines the batch and cache-hit inputs to the timing source. Choose one timing
source for each worker role with `engine.workers.<role>.timing.type`.

The live Mocker CLI options for profile-derived interpolation and direct `--aic-*` configuration
are separate from the unified CLI. In AISimulate configurations, use only the timing types accepted
by the AISimulate YAML schema.

### AISimulate Performance Model

`timing.type: default` uses the AISimulate performance model. AISimulate selects model data from
`engine.model`, `engine.hardware`, `engine.backend`, the optional `engine.backend_version`, and the
role's parallelism mapping. Unsupported combinations fail instead of silently using an
uncalibrated timing model.

KV-capacity selection is independent of the timing source. With `kv_cache.capacity.type: default`,
AISimulate estimates capacity from the model, backend, hardware, parallelism, block size, and memory
fraction. With `type: fixed`, set the concrete block count in `blocks`.

### Fixed Timing

Set `timing.type: fixed` and provide both `prefill_ms` and `decode_ms` to apply constant durations:

```yaml
timing: {type: fixed, prefill_ms: 2, decode_ms: 0.5}
```

Use fixed timing for functional tests or controlled comparisons. These values replace the
AISimulate timing lookup but do not disable default KV-capacity estimation.

### Polynomial Baseline

Set `timing.type: polynomial` to use the uncalibrated synthetic baseline. Prefill latency follows a
polynomial over the uncached tokens scheduled in the pass. Decode latency follows a polynomial over
active KV-cache utilization.

## Prefill/Decode Handoff

For `engine.mode: disaggregated`, define `engine.workers.prefill` and
`engine.workers.decode`. Configure the modeled transfer under `engine.kv_transfer`:

```yaml
kv_transfer:
  bytes_per_token: auto
  bandwidth_gb_per_second: 400
  timing_mode: destination_missing
```

The offline simulation uses a per-request line-rate model:

```text
transfer time = transferred KV bytes / kv_transfer_bandwidth
transferred KV bytes = charged tokens * kv_bytes_per_token
```

`timing_mode: full_prompt` charges the full logical prompt. `destination_missing` charges only the
prompt footprint absent from the destination and can produce zero delay on a full destination hit.
Concurrent requests do not contend for a shared link.

Set `bytes_per_token: auto` to derive the value from model metadata and parallelism, or provide a
positive integer. Set a positive `bandwidth_gb_per_second` to apply the transfer delay. TensorRT-LLM
does not support disaggregated simulation.

## Distributed Signals

The internal worker runtime publishes the same categories of signals consumed by the distributed
runtime:

- stored and removed KV events for KV-aware routing;
- engine-shaped Prometheus scheduler and request metrics;
- per-rank cache, queue, running-request, and preemption counters;
- forward-pass metrics with scheduled and queued prefill/decode work.

Offline KV-router replay captures the corresponding scheduler events and applies them to an
in-process indexer at deterministic event boundaries.

## Fidelity Boundaries

Interpret simulation results within these boundaries:

- Timing accuracy depends on the selected timing source and its calibration range.
- KV capacity and state transitions are modeled; KV tensor payloads are not.
- The internal worker runtime includes Dynamo component and transport overhead but does not measure GPU kernel or
  inference-engine overhead.
- Offline replay replaces external services and wall-clock concurrency with an event queue and
  shared logical clock.
- TensorRT-LLM disaggregation and multi-tier KV offload are not modeled.
- Mocker simulates text-token processing; it does not model multimodal encoder or cross-attention
  compute.

Use offline prediction for broad algorithm and configuration exploration. Use live Mocker workers
to exercise the distributed path, and validate performance conclusions with focused GPU benchmarks.
