subtitle: Configure HTTPS, HTTP mutual TLS, and internal TCP/NATS encryption
---

NVIDIA Dynamo supports opt-in TLS encryption for the frontend HTTP API, the TCP
request and response streams between frontends and workers, and connections to
NATS. On the TCP transport, both the **request plane**
(frontend → worker inference requests) and the **response stream** (worker →
frontend inference output) are encrypted using
[rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) with the `ring` cryptographic
provider. When no TLS configuration is provided, these transports operate in
plaintext exactly as before.

The `DYN_TCP_TLS_*` environment variables encrypt the frontend↔worker TCP
request and response streams; NATS traffic is encrypted separately via NATS TLS
(see the NATS TLS section below). The KV event plane is a separate transport:
when it runs over ZMQ it is **not** encrypted, and when it runs over NATS it is
encrypted only if NATS TLS is configured.

## HTTP TLS and mTLS

The frontend accepts HTTPS connections from external clients or an API gateway.
Configure these options on the frontend; they are independent of the internal
`DYN_TCP_TLS_*` and `NATS_TLS_*` settings.

| Environment variable | Frontend CLI flag | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DYN_TLS_CERT_PATH` | `--tls-cert-path` | PEM server certificate. Set together with the server private key to enable HTTPS. |
| `DYN_TLS_KEY_PATH` | `--tls-key-path` | PEM private key for the server certificate. |
| `DYN_TLS_CLIENT_CA_CERT_PATH` | `--tls-client-ca-cert-path` | PEM CA certificates trusted to sign client certificates. Enables HTTP mutual TLS (mTLS). |

HTTP mTLS requires both the server certificate and private key. When a client
CA is configured, the frontend rejects TLS handshakes from clients that omit a
certificate or present one that is not trusted by that CA. Without a client CA,
HTTPS authenticates only the server. The client or API gateway configures its
own client certificate/key and trust for the frontend's server certificate.

The frontend loads its HTTP TLS configuration at startup. Its server
certificate and private key hot-reload for subsequent handshakes; changing the
trusted client CA requires a restart. See [Design notes](#design-notes) for
rotation behavior and the [frontend configuration reference](frontend-configuration.mdx)
for the complete frontend argument list.

## Environment variables

The following variables configure internal TCP TLS. Server configuration is
validated when the server starts; client connectors initialize lazily on the
first outbound connection.

Both frontends and workers act as TCP server and client depending on the
stream direction (response streams: worker dials frontend; request streams:
frontend dials worker). Set the internal TCP TLS configuration on every
participating pod. HTTP TLS settings apply only to the frontend HTTP server.

### Server role (accepting connections)

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_CERT_PATH` | Path to the PEM certificate file. When set together with `DYN_TCP_TLS_KEY_PATH`, TLS is enabled on the TCP server. |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_KEY_PATH` | Path to the PEM private key for the server certificate. |

### Client role (dialing connections)

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH` | Path to the PEM CA certificate used to verify the peer's server certificate. |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_INSECURE` | Set to `1` or `true` to skip certificate verification. For local development only. |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_SERVER_NAME` | Override the TLS SNI hostname. Useful when connecting by IP to a server whose certificate has a DNS SAN. |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | TLS handshake timeout in seconds (default: 3). |

## CLI flags

The same configuration is available via command-line flags on all backends
(vllm, sglang, trtllm, tokenspeed) through `DynamoRuntimeArgGroup`:

```
--tcp-tls-cert-path PATH      Server certificate (PEM)
--tcp-tls-key-path PATH       Server private key (PEM)
--tcp-tls-ca-cert-path PATH   CA certificate for server verification (PEM)
--tcp-tls-insecure             Disable certificate verification
--tcp-tls-server-name NAME     Override TLS SNI hostname
--tcp-tls-handshake-timeout N  Handshake timeout in seconds (default: 3)
```

The frontend (`dynamo.frontend`) also accepts `--tcp-tls-cert-path`,
`--tcp-tls-key-path`, and `--tcp-tls-ca-cert-path`.

## Quick start

Generate a self-signed certificate for local testing:

```bash
# Generate CA
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem \
  -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=DynamoCA"

# Generate server cert with SAN
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server-key.pem -out server-csr.pem \
  -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"

openssl x509 -req -in server-csr.pem -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem \
  -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem -days 365 -copy_extensions copyall
```

Both frontend and worker need the same flags (both act as server and client):

```bash
python -m dynamo.vllm \
  --tcp-tls-cert-path server-cert.pem \
  --tcp-tls-key-path server-key.pem \
  --tcp-tls-ca-cert-path ca-cert.pem \
  --tcp-tls-server-name localhost \
  ...

python -m dynamo.frontend \
  --tcp-tls-cert-path server-cert.pem \
  --tcp-tls-key-path server-key.pem \
  --tcp-tls-ca-cert-path ca-cert.pem \
  --tcp-tls-server-name localhost \
  ...
```

## Kubernetes deployment

In Kubernetes, TLS certificates are typically delivered by a certificate
management system and mounted into pods. Set the
environment variables on each component's pod template in the
`DynamoGraphDeployment` spec:

```yaml
spec:
  components:
  - name: Frontend
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: main
          env:
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_CERT_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/server/cert.pem
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_KEY_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/server/key.pem
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/ca/ca.pem
  - name: worker
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: main
          env:
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_CERT_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/server/cert.pem
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_KEY_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/server/key.pem
          - name: DYN_TCP_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH
            value: /etc/certs/ca/ca.pem
```

Both components need the same TLS env vars because each acts as both TCP
server and client depending on the stream direction.

For platform-wide TLS that the operator injects into every deployment
automatically — instead of setting env vars on each component — see
[Operator TLS](../../kubernetes/installation/tls.md).

## NATS TLS

NATS carries JetStream indexer recovery/replay, the audit sink, and — when the
request plane is set to NATS (`--request-plane nats`) — inference request
distribution. TLS is configured separately from TCP:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NATS_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH` | CA certificate to verify the NATS server. When set, a custom TLS config is applied. |
| `NATS_TLS_INSECURE` | Skip NATS server certificate verification (dev only). |

When only the `tls://` URL scheme is used without explicit TLS env vars,
async-nats handles TLS natively with system roots.

The `NATS_SERVER` URL accepts both `nats://` and `tls://` schemes, but setting
any explicit NATS TLS variable (`NATS_TLS_*`) requires the `tls://` scheme —
startup fails with a clear error otherwise.

CLI flags (all backends via `DynamoRuntimeArgGroup`):

```text
--nats-tls-ca-cert-path PATH   CA certificate for NATS server verification (PEM)
--nats-tls-insecure             Disable NATS certificate verification
```

The frontend (`dynamo.frontend`) also accepts `--nats-tls-ca-cert-path` and
`--nats-tls-insecure`.

### Enabling TLS on the NATS server

The env vars above configure the **client** side (Dynamo verifying the NATS
server). For TLS to work, the NATS server itself must also be configured to
listen on TLS — otherwise a client that sets `NATS_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH` (or the
operator-level `natsTLSCAPath`) will attempt a TLS handshake against a
plaintext port and fail.

When deploying Dynamo's platform chart, the bundled NATS subchart exposes this
via `nats.config.nats.tls`. The certificates are typically delivered by a
certificate management system such as cert-manager.

**One-way TLS** (server presents a cert, clients verify it):

```yaml
# NATS server side — platform chart values
nats:
  config:
    nats:
      tls:
        enabled: true
        secretName: nats-server-tls   # Secret with tls.crt / tls.key (e.g. cert-manager)
```

Or, if the cert files are mounted into the pod by an external system, use the
`merge` block to point at the on-disk paths directly:

```yaml
nats:
  config:
    nats:
      tls:
        enabled: true
        merge:
          cert_file: /etc/certs/server/cert.pem
          key_file:  /etc/certs/server/key.pem
          timeout:   2
```

Then point the Dynamo clients at the TLS endpoint and give them the CA.
These are operator-subchart values, so nest them under `dynamo-operator:` when
using the platform chart:

```yaml
dynamo-operator:
  natsAddr: "tls://dynamo-platform-nats.dynamo-system.svc.cluster.local:4222"
  natsTLSCAPath: /etc/certs/ca/ca.pem   # → NATS_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH
```

**mTLS** (server also verifies client certs) — add `ca_file` and `verify` to
the server's `merge` block, and present a client identity from the Dynamo side:

```yaml
# NATS server side
nats:
  config:
    nats:
      tls:
        enabled: true
        merge:
          cert_file: /etc/certs/server/cert.pem
          key_file:  /etc/certs/server/key.pem
          ca_file:   /etc/certs/client-ca/ca.pem   # verify client certs
          verify:    true                          # require client certs
```

```yaml
# Dynamo client side (operator-level, nested under dynamo-operator:)
dynamo-operator:
  natsTLSCAPath:         /etc/certs/ca/ca.pem
  natsTLSClientCertPath: /etc/certs/client/cert.pem
  natsTLSClientKeyPath:  /etc/certs/client/key.pem
```

See the [NATS TLS documentation](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/tls)
for the full server-side TLS schema.

## Mutual TLS (mTLS)

By default only the server is authenticated (the client verifies the server's
certificate). Mutual TLS additionally makes the **client present a certificate**
that the **server verifies**, so both ends of a connection prove their identity.
mTLS is opt-in and layered on top of the TLS configuration above.

For the **TCP** transports (request plane + response stream) Dynamo owns both
ends, so configure two things and — since every component is both TCP client and
server — set both on every pod:

- **On the client:** a client certificate/key to present.
- **On the server:** a CA certificate (`DYN_TCP_TLS_CLIENT_CA_CERT_PATH`) to
  verify the presented client certificate. When set, the server **requires** a
  trusted client certificate and rejects the handshake otherwise.

For **NATS** the broker is external, so Dynamo only presents a client identity —
there is no Dynamo-side "server" half. Whether client certificates are actually
required is enforced by the **NATS server** configuration (e.g.
`tls { ca_file: ...; verify: true }`), not by Dynamo.

### TCP request/response streams

| Variable | Role | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH` | Client | PEM client certificate presented to the server. Set with `DYN_TCP_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`. |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH` | Client | PEM private key for the client certificate. |
| `DYN_TCP_TLS_CLIENT_CA_CERT_PATH` | Server | PEM CA used to verify client certificates. When set, clients **must** present a certificate signed by this CA. |

### NATS

| Variable | Role | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NATS_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH` | Client | PEM client certificate presented to the NATS server. Set with `NATS_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`. |
| `NATS_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH` | Client | PEM private key for the NATS client certificate. |

> **Note:** Dynamo cannot detect whether the NATS broker actually requests a
> client certificate. If you set `NATS_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`/`_KEY_PATH` but the
> broker is not configured to verify client certs, the connection silently
> falls back to ordinary one-way TLS. Enable verification on the NATS server
> (`verify: true`) to make NATS mTLS effective.

Client certificate and key must be set **together**, and a client identity
requires a server CA (`*_CA_CERT_PATH`) — or insecure mode for development — so
the server can still be verified. The TCP **servers** and the **NATS** client
validate this at startup and fail closed. The TCP **client** connectors,
however, initialize lazily on the first outbound connection, so an incomplete
TCP client config surfaces as a per-connection handshake failure rather than a
startup crash. The client certificate/key hot-reload from disk on rotation,
exactly like the server certificate (see Design notes).

The same options are available as CLI flags on all backends (via
`DynamoRuntimeArgGroup`) and the frontend (`dynamo.frontend`):

```text
--tcp-tls-client-cert-path PATH      Client certificate presented for TCP mTLS (PEM)
--tcp-tls-client-key-path PATH       Client private key for TCP mTLS (PEM)
--tcp-tls-client-ca-cert-path PATH   CA to verify client certs; enforces TCP mTLS (PEM)
--nats-tls-client-cert-path PATH     Client certificate presented for NATS mTLS (PEM)
--nats-tls-client-key-path PATH      Client private key for NATS mTLS (PEM)
```

## Encrypted paths

When TLS is configured, the following transports are encrypted (the ZMQ event
plane is not covered):

| Path | Direction | Data | Transport |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP API | Client/API gateway → Frontend | API requests and responses | HTTPS; optional client-certificate authentication |
| Request plane | Frontend → Worker | User prompts, request metadata | `egress/tcp_client` → `ingress/shared_tcp_endpoint` |
| Response stream | Worker → Frontend | Inference output tokens | `tcp/client` → `tcp/server` |
| Request stream | Frontend → Worker | Streaming input (bidirectional) | `tcp/client` → `tcp/server` |
| NATS | Frontend/Worker ↔ NATS | Inference requests (when `--request-plane nats`), JetStream recovery, audit logs | `transports/nats` |

## Design notes

- HTTP server certificates and private keys use the shared hot-reload resolver.
  A background thread checks for file changes every 30 seconds
  (sooner after a failed reload). Valid updates apply to subsequent handshakes;
  existing connections remain open, and a failed reload retains the last valid
  certificate. The HTTP client CA is loaded at startup and requires a frontend
  restart after rotation.
- Server certificates hot-reload: the request-plane and response-stream servers
  serve their leaf cert/key through a resolver that re-reads the files from disk
  when their contents change (detected by a content hash, so rotations done by
  an atomic symlink swap are handled too), so certificate rotation
  takes effect **without a process restart**. The check is rate-limited (at most
  once every 30s, sooner after a failed reload) and never blocks a handshake; a
  failed reload keeps serving the last valid certificate. Client trust anchors
  (the CA) are still loaded once, so rotating the CA itself requires a restart.
- mTLS **client identity** certificates hot-reload through the same resolver, so
  a rotated client cert/key is picked up without a restart. The CA used by the
  server to verify client certificates is loaded once (rotating it needs a
  restart).
- Client TLS connectors are built once and cached via `OnceCell` on the first
  outbound connection.
- The TLS handshake is spawned per-connection on both the request plane and
  response stream servers so the accept loop is never blocked.
- Invalid TLS configuration on the request plane (e.g. bad cert path) prevents
  server startup rather than silently falling back to plaintext.
- When server and client TLS configurations are mismatched (e.g., server has TLS
  but client does not), a warning is logged at startup.
- An empty CA certificate file is detected at load time and rejected with a
  clear error message.
